                    <ul>
                        <li>Providing PhD students with a supportive forum to submit and receive high-quality feedback about their accessibility-related dissertation work from researchers outside their own institution, including student peers, faculty, and industry professionals.</li>
                        <li>Providing opportunities for participants to network with one another and senior members of the ASSETS community.</li>
                        <li>Enabling the student participants to attend the ASSETS 2022 conference, to contribute to the conference goals through interaction with other researchers and conference events, and to learn of potential career paths within academia and industry.</li>

                    <p>We encourage doctoral candidates at an early-to-mid stage of their research to apply rather than students who have already made substantial progress towards their dissertation. The DC focuses on earlier-stage students because the goal is to provide feedback that can help guide and shape dissertation research agendas.</p>
                    <p>Applicants may also submit to the Student Research Competition, but the work described must be different.</p>
