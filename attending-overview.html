              <p>The pandemic has changed the way people access and expect to access information, build community, and
                experience conferences. What does this mean for ASSETS? Together with the ASSETS'22 Organizing Committee,
                the ASSETS Steering Committee, and the SIGACCESS Executive Committee, we have attempted to design a conference experience that reflects
                and strengthens our leadership as the premier academic conference in accessibility and computing while
                balancing community needs, technical and pragmatic constraints, and an agile approach necessary in the
                ever-changing dynamics of COVID. If you have a questions or concern, please do not hesitate to email

              <h3 class="text-center" tabindex="0">A New Format for ASSETS'22</h3>
              <p>For the first time in our conference history, ASSETS will offer both an in-person conference experience
                and a lighter-weight virtual option. We will not be live streaming content. Instead, all attendees will be able to
                view pre-recorded captioned videos and interact with authors and other attendees via our conference
                <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord server</a>. Discord is a chat service similar to Slack that we 
                successfully used at ASSETS 2020 and 2021. 
                In addition, we will have some "crossover" events to bridge the "virtual" and "on-site"
                worlds.</p>
                <!-- Unlike ASSETS 2020 and 2021, which were all-virtual and used Zoom
                for live presentations and Discord for discussions, the remote aspect of ASSETS 2022 will be fully
                asynchronous over Discord.  -->
              <p>Our conference plan is informed by:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Our experiences running ASSETS virtually in 2020 and 2021;</li>
                <li>The needs and expectations of our community;</li>
                <li>The technical capabilities and resources necessary to provide reliable and consistent content
                  (<i>e.g.,</i> Internet bandwidth and connectivity in the hotel);</li>
                <li>Time zone differences between Athens and expected attendee time zones (<i>e.g.,</i> where our
                  conference historically draws attendees from);</li>
                <li>Our observations of other "hybrid" conferences this past year;</li>
                <li>Continued monitoring of COVID rates and projections;</li>
                <li>Countless discussions amongst the ASSETS'22 Organizing Committee, the ASSETS Steering Committee, and the SIGACCESS Executive Committee.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h4>Guiding Principles</h4>
              <p>Further, early in conference planning (~Sept 2021), we collectively brainstormed and iterated upon the
                following organizing principles:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Accessible.</b> We are the flagship ACM conference on accessibility. Accessibility should be the
                  cornerstone of all of our design decisions.</li>
                <li><b>Safety and wellbeing.</b> The safety and wellbeing of our community is paramount. Let us
                  continuously assess and reassess plans based on the dynamics of COVID.</li>
                <li><b>Value.</b> We should provide value to our participants—both virtual attendees and on-site
                  attendees—in terms of intellectual value, networking value, social value, <i>etc.</i></li>
                <li><b>Simple over complex.</b> Running a conference—either physical or virtual—is complex. Running a
                  hybrid conference is even more so. Let us then brainstorm ambitiously but be pragmatic in our final
                  pursuits. ASSETS'22 is just the beginning. We prefer simple and successful rather than complicated and
                  failure.</li>
                <li><b>Equitable representation.</b> We want the work of authors who attend virtually or on-site to be
                  equitably represented.</li>
                <li><b>Nimble and flexible.</b> Relatedly, let us maintain an agility and nimbleness that befits a small
                  conference and that we so demonstrated during the virtual conference years.</li>
                <li><b>Experimental.</b> While potentially contradictory with the two bullets above, we should also be a
                  bit experimental in our choices—not everything that we plan or try this year will succeed (no matter
                  how much effort we expend). So let us realize that we are setting a much larger and longer course for
                  ASSETS beyond just 2022.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Presenting at ASSETS'22</h4>
              <p>If you have accepted work to present at ASSETS'22, congratulations! We want you and your work to
                receive the
                attention it deserves. At least one author of accepted technical papers, posters and demonstrations, or
                other
                artifact-based tracks is expected to travel to Athens to present their work. See the 
                <a href="attending-athens.html">Attending in Athens</a> webpage
               and <a href="#conference-experience">Conference Experience</a>
                section below for more details.
                
              <p>  If traveling to ASSETS is
                inaccessible
                to you or presents an insurmountable COVID health/safety risk for you, please email <a
                  href="mailto:assets22-leadership@acm.org">assets22-leadership@acm.org</a>, and we
                can find ways to accommodate you. ASSETS'22 is planned primarily as an in-person event with an
                asynchronous option
                for individuals to view pre-recorded videos and engage in discussion on Discord. We will not be live
                streaming
                content. For those presenters who cannot travel to Athens, we will play a pre-recorded, captioned video
                to the
                in-person audience. See below for more details.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center" tabindex="0">Attending Virtually</h3>
              <p>While COVID has been hard on all of us—both personally and professionally—the shift to a virtual format
                for ASSETS'20
                and '21 led to significant increases in attendance and geographic diversity with 395 and 424 registrants, respectively, compared
                to 211 for
                ASSETS'19 in Pittsburgh and 164 for ASSETS'18 in Galway, Ireland. This shows an incredible, untapped
                interest in the
                ASSETS community and our work! But what was the quality of this virtual experience like? What was better
                and what
                was worse compared with a traditional conference experience? How can we learn from other conferences
                that have
                attempted hybrid or virtual formats?</p>
              <p>In the past year, we have repeatedly investigated and discussed these questions, and have settled a
                plan that we feel
                provides value to the community and can be reliably executed. Our virtual conference experience does not
                rely on
                live streaming and time zone synchronization. Instead, virtual attendees will engage via Discord—similar
                to how
                Discord was used for ASSETS'20 and '21—and have access to pre-recorded, captioned videos. 
                See the <a href="#conference-experience">Conference Experience</a> section below for more details.</p>

              <p>With the above principles as a guide, we have planned the following conference experience. As with ASSETS'21,
                each session will be given its own Discord channel to foster and collate discussion. We will not
                be
