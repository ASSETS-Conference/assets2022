                the heart of Athens, Greece between Syntagma and Omonia squares and Metro stations Panepistimio & Omonia.

              </p>
              <p>
                To protect the health and safety of our community, we require that all on-site attendees have proof of 
                full vaccination or a legitimate medical or religious exemption. Additionally, we will be requiring masks at all conference events. 
                We strongly encourage a well-fitting, high filtration mask such as a N95, KF94, FFP2, or KN95 mask.

                  government's official website</a> and the

                The Greek
                National Tourism Organization launched the Visit Greece app (<a

              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Before the conference,</b> we ask that you conduct a COVID test (either PCR or antigen) within
                  three days of Oct 23 and kindly ask that you not travel if the test is positive or if you feel sick.
                </li>
                <li><b>En route to the conference.</b> While many airlines and rail transport no longer require masking,
                  we ask that you use a high-filtration, closely fitting mask such as a N95, FFP2, KF94, or KN95 while
                  traveling to the conference, including on all public transportation.</li>
                <li><b>Vaccination status.</b> We require that all on-site attendees have proof of full vaccination or a
                  legitimate medical or religious exemption. Note that as of May 1, 2022, the Greek government no longer
                  requires proof of vaccination to travel to the country.</li>
                <li><b>Masking.</b> We will be requiring masks at all conference events. We strongly encourage a
                  well-fitting, high filtration mask such as a N95, KF94, FFP2, or KN95 mask (see this <a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/where-to-buy-n95-kn95-masks-online/">NYTimes
                    article</a>). We are working to provide a backup stock at the conference; however, please bring
                  enough supply for yourself so you can wear a fresh mask each day. As of June 1, 2022, Greece no longer
                  requires masking indoors; however, masks are still required on public transit and in healthcare
                  facilities (<a href="https://gr.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">source</a>).</li>
                <li><b>Eating/drinking.</b> Traditionally, ASSETS provides food/drink during conference breaks, for
                  lunch, and during social events. We are working with the hotel and our social event venues to
                  determine takeaway options for attendees to eat outside if they prefer. For this, we suggest bringing
                  a washable (<i>e.g.,</i> rubbermaid, pyrex) or disposable container as we cannot guarantee that our
                  food providers will have "togo" boxes.</li>
                <li><b>Feeling sick?</b> If you feel sick during the conference, please send an email to <a
                    href="mailto:conferencestaff@acm.org">conferencestaff@acm.org</a>, take a rapid antigen test, and
                  stay in your hotel room. When in doubt, take steps to minimize contact with others. Please bring some
                  rapid tests with you to the conference; we will have a small number of backups.</li>
                <li><b>Reporting.</b> All attendees at ASSETS agree to self-monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID and
                  to contact ACM's official reporting contact <a
                    href="mailto:conferencestaff@acm.org">conferencestaff@acm.org</a> if you test positive for COVID
                  within 10 days after participating.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We will continuously monitor COVID information in Athens and international health recommendations. The
