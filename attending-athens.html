                  we ask that you use a high-filtration, closely fitting mask such as a N95, FFP2, KF94, or KN95 while
                  traveling to the conference, including on all public transportation (which is currently mandatory in
                  Greece).</li>
                <li><b>Vaccination status.</b> We require that all on-site attendees have proof of full vaccination or a
                  legitimate medical or religious exemption. Note that as of May 1, 2022, the Greek government no longer
                  requires proof of vaccination to travel to the country.</li>
                <li><b>Masking.</b> We will be requiring masks at all conference events. We strongly encourage a
                  well-fitting, high filtration mask such as a N95, KF94, FFP2, or KN95 mask (see this <a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/where-to-buy-n95-kn95-masks-online/">NYTimes
                    article</a>). We are working to provide a backup stock at the conference; however, please bring
                  enough supply for yourself so you can wear a fresh mask each day. As of June 1, 2022, Greece no longer
                  requires masking indoors; however, masks are still required on public transit and in healthcare
                  facilities (<a href="https://gr.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">source</a>).</li>
                <li><b>Eating/drinking.</b> Traditionally, ASSETS provides food/drink during conference breaks, for
                  lunch, and during social events. We are working with the hotel and our social event venues to
                  determine takeaway options for attendees to eat outside if they prefer. For this, we suggest bringing
                  a washable (<i>e.g.,</i> rubbermaid, pyrex) or disposable container as we cannot guarantee that our
                  food providers will have "togo" boxes.</li>
                <li><b>Feeling sick?</b> If you feel sick during the conference, please send an email to <a
                    href="mailto:conferencestaff@acm.org">conferencestaff@acm.org</a>, take a rapid antigen test, and
                  stay in your hotel room. When in doubt, take steps to minimize contact with others. Please bring some
                  rapid tests with you to the conference; we will have a small number of backups.</li>
                <li><b>Reporting.</b> All attendees at ASSETS agree to self-monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID and
                  to contact ACM's official reporting contact <a
                    href="mailto:conferencestaff@acm.org">conferencestaff@acm.org</a> if you test positive for COVID
                  within 10 days after participating.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We will continuously monitor COVID information in Athens and international health recommendations. The
                above list is subject to change.</p>
                <h4>More about Masking</h4>
                <p>
                We require masks at all conference events and ask that you also wear masks while using public transit.
                Speakers can take off their mask for the duration of their talks.
                If you have forgotten a mask, we have some N95s as a backup. You can get them from the registration desk.
                Please be aware that ASSETS leadership
                and student volunteers will be monitoring mask usage and will kindly remind you to use a mask during our events.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of you have asked about whether to wear <strong>clear masks</strong>—which allow others to see your lips and thus 
                have certain accessibility advantages—or traditional high-filtration masks like N95s. This is a personal choice.
                We have purchased 50 clear masks from <a href="https://bendshapemask.com/products/mask">BendShape</a> (25 small; 25 medium)
                in addition to 160 3M 9205 N95 Aura masks.
              </p>
              <p>
                For context, Hybrid Experience Chair, Professor Christian Vogler, shares his experience with BendShape masks at
                <a href="https://gallaudet.edu/">Gallaudet University</a>: 
                "<i>clear masks have very poor acoustic properties. so a person who has to speak through 
                them will be noticeably harder to understand than someone who just uses a well-fitting KN95, 
                FFP2 or N95 mask. They are indicated if someone in the audience relies on facial cues for 
                access (for sign language), or on lip-reading.</i>"
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, Christian makes the following recommendation:
                <ol>
                  <li>If the presenter is signing, use clear masks (or no mask)</li>
                  <li>If the presenter is speaking to a hearing audience and the interpreters and 
                    captioners have access needs fully covered, use a standard high-filtration mask</li>
                  <li>If a speaking presenter would like to offer accessible facial cues and lip 
                    movements to the audience, they need to enunciate very clearly to ensure that access is 
                    not worse for people (including some deaf/hard of hearing people) who primarily rely on 
                    auditory cues and to ensure that the captioners and interpreters can still understand their speech.</li>
                </ol>
