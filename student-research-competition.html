                    <p>The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) is an event open to undergraduate and graduate students. At the conference, the authors will present their poster to a panel of experts and those who qualify to the next round will present their research to the conference audience. All accepted SRC submissions will be published in the conference proceedings and the best presentations will receive a prize. The SRC is a fantastic opportunity to be introduced to the community and establish networks with fellow scientists.</p>

                    <h4>Testimonials</h4>

                    <p><i>“...What really caught my eye was how the community fosters growth and how the competition encourages us to learn the methodology behind other projects to improve our own.”</i></p>
                    <p><em>    —Yash Naik, University of Mumbai, SRC undergraduate student participant in 2018</em></p>

                    <p><i>“The SRC was one of the most engaging and intriguing activities of my Ph.D. journey. Besides the ‘eye-opening’ experience the competition offered, I had very insightful feedback on my research, met other student researchers and established relationships I believe would last a lifetime!”</i></p>
                    <p><em>    —Andrew A. Bayor, Queensland University of Technology, SRC graduate student participant, 2019</em></p>

                    <p><i>"The ASSETS 2020 SRC was both our first conference attending and presenting. Being able to connect with leading students and researchers in our field was not only exciting, but it was tremendously helpful for pushing our research forward. Additionally, we were able to meet and connect with so many great undergraduate and graduate students in the SRC who are doing amazing research in accessibility. I know that the friendships, acquaintances, and conversations we made and had will help us for years to come. We would recommend the SRC to anyone looking for a great learning experience as new researchers."</i></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Participants must be currently enrolled (at the time of submission) in a university or college and have an active ACM student membership. If you are not a member yet, you can <a href="https://campus.acm.org/public/qj/quickjoin/qj_control.cfm?form_type=Student" target="_blank">join the ACM</a> by paying a US$19 fee per year.</li>
                        <li><b>At the graduate level (MS or PhD students), only individual research is accepted</b>. Group research projects <u>will not</u> be considered, meaning graduate submissions cannot include advisor names.If an individual is part of a group research project and wants to participate in an SRC, they can only present their part of the research (their contribution to the project). <!--Only the individual author will receive the travel stipend and monetary award (should they win).--></li>
                        <li><b>At the undergraduate level, team projects are acceptable</b>. All team members should be undergraduate students. One team member should be designated to attend the conference and make the oral presentation. Students may only participate in one ACM SRC per program year (July 1-June 30). Students that have applied to an SRC, but have not been accepted, may respond to other SRC calls for participation during the program year.</li>
                        <li>Work accepted as a full paper for one of the technical sessions of the conference cannot also be considered for the Student Research Competition. Students having a technical paper, however, are encouraged to submit separate work to the Student Research Competition.</li>
                        <li>The same topic of work cannot be presented at more than one of the conference venues (SRC, DC, or as a regular technical paper).</li>
                        <li>SRC submissions should not be under review at other conferences or similar venues.</li>

                    <h4>For whom?</h4>
                    <p>The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) is an event open to undergraduate and graduate students.</p>

                    <!-- <h4>Is there any support?</h4>
                    <p>Students selected to participate in the SRC will receive partial support to attend the conference.</p> -->

                    <h4>What needs to be submitted?</h4>
                    <p>Students wishing to participate submit abstracts of their work. Qualifying research must deal with topics that are relevant to the mission of the ASSETS series, as described by the <a href="call-for-papers.html">Call for Papers</a>. Preference will be given to work that has been completed (or close to completion).</p>
                    <p>Submissions have a 4,000 to 5,000 word limit using templates that can be found in the <a href="submission-templates.html">Submission Templates page</a>. Note that references <u>do not</u> count toward page limits.</p>
                    <p>Successful entries will be published in the ASSETS 2022 proceedings and the ACM Digital Library. Submissions (in PDF format) should be submitted by the deadline: June 23, 2022, 5 P.M. Pacific Time (GMT -8:00). It is important to note that these are NOT anonymous submissions; the authors' names should be on the paper.</p>
                    <p>In addition, <b>after acceptance</b>, authors will be required to prepare a short audio speech file describing the content of their posters. This feature makes posters more accessible to blind and low vision attendees. More details on this will be available in due course.</p>
                    <p>Your PDF file must be accessible. Please refer to the instructions on <a href="guidelines-policies.html#a11y-pdfs">Creating an Accessible ACM Conference Paper</a> for information on how to accomplish this. If you cannot create an accessible PDF at submission time then you will be given the option to upload either an accessible HTML or Microsoft Word version of your paper in addition to your PDF to facilitate review. If your paper is accepted, the final version will need to be transformed into an accessible PDF document.</p>
                    <p>Writing Guidelines are available to help authors choose appropriate language for <a href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-writing-guide/" target="_blank">writing about technology and people with disabilities</a>.

                    <p>Once SRC submissions are reviewed, accepted projects will be invited to present at ASSETS 2022.</p>

                    <p>Given the hybrid format of the conference, the current expectation is that at least one author from all categories present their work physically or virtually at the conference. In addition, we will ask all authors to prepare prerecorded and captioned videos that will be made available to all attendees (both virtual-only attendees and on-site attendees). If you have disability or health concerns that prevent travel, please contact <a href="mailto:assets22-leadership@acm.org">assets22-leadership@acm.org</a>.</p>

                    <p>At the conference, there will be two rounds of competition:</p>

                    <h4>First Round Competition</h4>
                    <p>Participants will present a poster to a panel of judges. After the judges have reviewed the posters and discussed the research with each participant, a group of semi-finalists for each category (undergraduate and graduate) will be selected to present at the second round of the competition.</p>

                    <h4>Second Round Competition</h4>
                    <p>Semi-finalists will then give an oral presentation on their work as part of a main conference session. A panel of judges will evaluate their knowledge of the research area, their contribution to the field, and the quality of the presentation.</p>
                    <p>Three winners will be chosen in each category, undergraduate and graduate, receiving their medals (gold, silver, and bronze) and a monetary prize of $500, $300, and $200, respectively sponsored by ACM. First place winners will be designated as finalists and will also advance to the SRC Grand Finals. Participants should plan to stay through the ASSETS conference as the awards ceremony will take place during the closing session.</p>
                    <p><b>Note</b>: Upon request, American Sign Language interpreters will be provided for participants in the SRC, both during the competition itself and for the remainder of the ASSETS conference. Requests for an interpreter must be indicated on the conference registration form when registering for ASSETS.</p>
