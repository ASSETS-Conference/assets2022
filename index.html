                <p>A new era of conferences and information exchange is upon us. The pandemic changed the way people access and expect to access information, build community, and experience conferences. Reflecting this new world, ASSETS’22 will be a hybrid conference, the first in our 24 years with a full, on-site conference experience in Athens, Greece and a lightweight, virtual component accessible via the Internet. Shifting to a hybrid format brings forth new opportunities and challenges in making conferences accessible, building community, and broadening participation. We currently do not plan on streaming content but will, instead, provide prerecorded videos of content with captions and opportunities for virtual and on-site attendees to interact via online tools. At least one author of technical papers, posters and demonstrations, and other artifact-based tracks must travel to Athens to present their work (other co-authors can choose to attend on-site or virtually).</p>

                                <p>Acknowledging the impact the pandemic has had on all of us and the transformation in
                                    how people access and expect to access information and interact together, ASSETS’22
                                    will be the first-ever “hybrid” conference in its 24 years. During the conference
                                    dates (Oct 24-26), we will host a full, on-site conference experience in Athens,
                                    Greece and a complementary, lighter-weight virtual experience online. ASSETS'22 also
                                    introduces our first-ever
                                    workshop track, which will take place Oct 23 and is intended to further grow and
                                    diversify our community and foster additional scholarship and discussion. </p>
