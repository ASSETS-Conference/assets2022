                  Girma</a> is a human rights lawyer
                advancing disability justice. President Obama named her a White House Champion of Change. She received
                the Helen Keller Achievement Award, a spot on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, and TIME100 Talks. President
                Bill Clinton, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Chancellor Angela Merkel have all honored Haben. Haben
                believes disability is an opportunity for innovation, and she teaches organizations the importance of
                choosing inclusion. The New York Times, Oprah Magazine, and TODAY Show featured her memoir, Haben: The
                Deafblind Woman Who Conquered Harvard Law.
