              <p>For the first time in our conference history, we have a workshops track. 🎉
                To host a workshop at ASSETS, workshop organizers submitted a proposal following the <a
                  href="workshops.html">Workshop Proposal CFP</a> in June, 2022. These proposals were then
                peer reviewed by the community and selected by the Workshop Track Co-chairs,
                Kyle Montague and Sowmya Somanath (<a
                  href="mailto:workshops-assets22@acm.org">workshops-assets22@acm.org</a>).</p>

              <p>Ultimately, five workshops were selected (listed below). To attend a workshop, please see the
                individual workshop webpages—each have their own CFPs and participation criteria.</p>

              <p><b>Virtual Workshop Date:</b> Monday, October 17th (tentative)</p>
              <p>There is widespread lack of accessibility in built environments, from roads and housing to public
                building and spaces. Such inaccessible urban infrastructure not only contributes to and further
                reinforces systemic exclusion of people with disabilities but also impacts public health, physical
                activity, and quality of life for all. To improve the design of our cities and to enable new
                accessibility-infused analytic tools and interactive maps, we need new data collection techniques, data
                standards, policies, and planning tools focused on the quality and accessibility of pathways, transit
                ecosystems, and buildings.</p>
              <p>The goal of our "The Future of Urban Accessibility" workshop is to bring together a community of
                scholars and practitioners across disciplines, disability identities, cultures, and geographies to
                discuss the state of urban accessibility and the role of interactive technologies therein. We invite
                short papers, including experience reports, position papers, vision pieces, demonstrations, pictorials,
                or research summaries up to 2,000 words on this topic (references excluded). Papers should not be
                anonymized and, in addition to their primary content, should include a bio of each author and rationale
                for attending the workshop. Papers will be reviewed and selected by the co-organizers to balance topics,
                geographies, and communities of focus. Accepted authors will be required to register and virtually
                attend the workshop via Zoom on Mon, Oct 17th.</p>
              <p>Please submit your papers/artifacts <a

                handle submissions.</p>
              <p>Our overarching goal is to identify open challenges, share current work across disciplines, and spur
                new collaborations. As a secondary goal, we aim to synthesize and publish our discussions together in a

              <p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have explored ways to adapt co-design methods
                from physical to digital spaces to ensure that participatory activities could continue even when
                in-person engagement was not possible. While recent work has demonstrated clear benefits of online
                co-design, such as accessing "hard to reach" populations and reduced cost of running co-design
                workshops, it also highlights the challenges including barriers to participation due to "poor internet
                connection" and lack of participant engagement with the activities (e.g., mic on mute, video switched
                off). Additionally, for disabled people, the shift to digital has been a double-edged sword. While
                online collaboration has lifted the burden of traveling to workshop venues, the inaccessibility of
                online collaboration platforms has restricted participants' engagement and contribution. It also places
                the burden of adapting to the online collaboration space on the participants, which may present
                additional challenges for people who are unfamiliar with or faced with inaccessible collaboration
                methods and tools.</p>
              <p>We invite researchers, practitioners, and designers with an interest in creating accessible online
                co-design methods and tools for people of all abilities to submit case studies from their recent work in
                co-design.The main goal of this workshop is to provide a space for reflection on the strategies
                researchers and designers have used to conduct virtual/remote co-design with disabled and aging
                populations and drive an agenda for future disability inclusive research and design in HCI.</p>
              <p>Submissions can be made in the form of case studies or position papers (up to 1,000 words excluding
                references) in the single-column submission template stating their existing work or their position with
                respect to the workshop topic. Submissions should also include up to two discussion points and issues
                that participants would like to discuss in the workshop. More information is available on the <a

              <p>This workshop will bring together accessibility/industry professionals and computing educators to discuss the needs and goals of integrating accessibility into the computing curriculum. The workshop will have two objectives, 1) developing a consensus on learning objectives for accessibility and 2) sharing and developing materials for use in future classes. The outcomes of this workshop are to develop a white paper outlining the different learning objectives for teaching accessibility and to create a repository of materials to share different ways to integrate accessibility into their courses.</p>
              <p>The workshop will be open for all who would like to attend, including those who do not plan to attend the ASSETS Conference. We will have two levels of participation in the workshop, one for those who would like to share their experience or views on teaching accessibility and one for those who would like to teach accessibility in the future or be involved in the discussion of the learning goals. For all participants, we ask that they fill out the brief survey on the workshop website to provide their interests, time zones, and accommodations, if any. In addition, for those who would like to share their experiences, we ask for a submission of the module, project description, or syllabus of the course that integrates accessibility that can be shared in the repository. If an artifact is submitted, at least one of the presenters must be able to attend the workshop.</p>

              <p><b>Virtual Workshop Date:</b> Sunday, October 23th</p>
              <p>Historically, the accessibility community has focused on designing assistive technologies and systems related to single categories of impairments. While this approach is justifiable and contributes to the advancement of the field, many researchers argue that designing technologies for one impairment at a time contributes to an oversimplification of disability and does not reflect the real-world experiences of a significant number of users who live with multiple impairments. </p>
              <p>How can the accessibility field leverage theories and concepts from other disciplines (e.g. disability studies, medical humanities, social work, engineering, education) to support more appropriate and inclusive technologies for users with complex needs? How can future assistive technologies consider diverse sensory, cognitive, and physical characteristics? </p>
              <p>In this workshop, we invite researchers and practitioners of different disciplines interested in designing assistive technologies with and for people with multiple impairments or complex disabilities to submit <b>500-word abstracts</b> (excluding references) stating their existing work, new ideas, or critical position related to challenges in designing technologies for users with multidimensional needs. During the workshop day, we plan to expand discussions on how disability is framed in the accessibility research community and elicit existing, disparate views that relate to challenges in designing accessible systems for users with multidimensional needs. </p>
              <p>Abstracts should discuss the relevant academic literature, include short position statements or issues related to the workshop’s theme. We also welcome submissions in the form of videos or posters. Authors must ensure the accessibility of their submission by following the SIGACCESS template and accessibility guidelines. </p>
              <p>Submissions can be made by September 15, 2022 by emailing the abstract to <a href="mailto:arthur.theil@bcu.ac.uk">arthur.theil@bcu.ac.uk</a>. Authors will be notified by September 26. If accepted, at least one author must attend the virtual workshop at ASSETS 2022 on Sunday 23 October (via Zoom). Accepted abstracts will be posted to the workshop website ahead of the workshop date and will serve as the basis of discussion during the day. Authors will be invited to expand their abstracts and contribute to a Special Issue Journal submission after the workshop. </p>

              <p><b>Virtual Workshop Date:</b> Wednesday, Oct 19th</p>
              <p>This half-day workshop aims to focus on community building, enabling researchers to share experiences on how to design for and with people with Intellectual Disabilities, provide internal support, and establish new collaborations. Our pre-workshop plans propose asynchronous activities to support networking and to understand participants' preferences and needs. Workshop outcomes will help fill a gap in the available guidelines on including people with intellectual disabilities in research, which should lead to more accessible protocols and personalised and better fit-for-purpose technologies.</p>
              <p>Areas of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to, the following topics:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Verbal and non-verbal communication (e.g., language, AAC, signals, feedback)</li>
                <li>Methods for working with participants (e.g., experience reports, co-design, focus groups, scaffolding, active support)</li>
                <li>Design and development of hardware and software (e.g., inclusive applications, assistive technology, multisensory experiences, AR/VR)</li>
                <li>Assessment techniques (e.g., cards, multiple choices, open-ended questions, satisfaction surveys)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We are pleased to announce that this workshop is open to everyone interested in the topic, regardless of experience and expertise level. Participants will be able to apply in multiple ways:</p>
