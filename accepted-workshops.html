              <p>There is widespread lack of accessibility in built environments, from roads and housing to public building and spaces. Such inaccessible urban infrastructure not only contributes to and further reinforces systemic exclusion of people with disabilities but also impacts public health, physical activity, and quality of life for all. To improve the design of our cities and to enable new accessibility-infused analytic tools and interactive maps, we need new data collection techniques, data standards, policies, and planning tools focused on the quality and accessibility of pathways, transit ecosystems, and buildings.</p>
              <p>The goal of our "The Future of Urban Accessibility" workshop is to bring together a community of scholars and practitioners across disciplines, disability identities, cultures, and geographies to discuss the state of urban accessibility and the role of interactive technologies therein. We invite short papers, including experience reports, position papers, vision pieces, demonstrations, pictorials, or research summaries up to 2,000 words on this topic (references excluded). Papers should not be anonymized and, in addition to their primary content, should include a bio of each author and rationale for attending the workshop. Papers will be reviewed and selected by the co-organizers to balance topics, geographies, and communities of focus. Accepted authors will be required to register and virtually attend the workshop via Zoom on Mon, Oct 17th.</p>
              <p>Please submit your papers/artifacts <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/UrbanAccess2022/Submission/Index">using this submission link</a> by Thu, Sep 1 at 11:59PM AoE. We are using Microsoft's Conference Management Toolkit to handle submissions.</p>
              <p>Our overarching goal is to identify open challenges, share current work across disciplines, and spur new collaborations. As a secondary goal, we aim to synthesize and publish our discussions together in a jointly authored report perhaps to the SIGACCESS Newsletter or beyond.</p>
              <p>Please join us. We welcome your contributions! Email questions to: <a href="mailto:urbanaccess2022@cs.uw.edu">urbanaccess2022@cs.uw.edu</a>.</p>

              <p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have explored ways to adapt co-design methods from physical to digital spaces to ensure that participatory activities could continue even when in-person engagement was not possible. While recent work has demonstrated clear benefits of online co-design, such as accessing "hard to reach" populations and reduced cost of running co-design workshops, it also highlights the challenges including barriers to participation due to "poor internet connection" and lack of participant engagement with the activities (e.g., mic on mute, video switched off). Additionally, for disabled people, the shift to digital has been a double-edged sword. While online collaboration has lifted the burden of traveling to workshop venues, the inaccessibility of online collaboration platforms has restricted participants' engagement and contribution. It also places the burden of adapting to the online collaboration space on the participants, which may present additional challenges for people who are unfamiliar with or faced with inaccessible collaboration methods and tools.</p>
              <p>We invite researchers, practitioners, and designers with an interest in creating accessible online co-design methods and tools for people of all abilities to submit case studies from their recent work in co-design.The main goal of this workshop is to provide a space for reflection on the strategies researchers and designers have used to conduct virtual/remote co-design with disabled and aging populations and drive an agenda for future disability inclusive research and design in HCI.</p>
              <p>Submissions can be made in the form of case studies or position papers (up to 1,000 words excluding references) in the single-column submission template stating their existing work or their position with respect to the workshop topic. Submissions should also include up to two discussion points and issues that participants would like to discuss in the workshop. More information is available on the <a href="https://www.disabilityinnovation.com/projects/disability-inclusive-remote-co-design">workshop website</a>.</p>
