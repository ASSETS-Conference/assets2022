                    <p>Help from seasoned researchers is available through the ASSETS Mentoring Program. You may receive advice on a submission in any of the submission categories provided by ASSETS. If you think you would benefit from mentoring because you are new to presenting your research, new to the type of category you would like to submit to, or simply find preparing an English-language or accessible paper to be difficult, please consider applying for mentoring help.</p>
                    <p>Participating in the ASSETS Mentoring Program does not guarantee that ASSETS will accept your submission. However, most individuals who have used the mentoring service at ASSETS or at the CHI conference where it began have reported positive experiences and an improved understanding of what reviewers require in general.</p>
                    <p>To apply, email the Mentor Chairs, Sayan Sarcar and Kirsten Ellis at <a href="mailto:mentoring-assets22@acm.org">mentoring-assets22@acm.org</a> by <b>TBD</b>.</p>
                    <p><ol>
                        <li>A one-page extended abstract of your paper</li>
                        <li>A short explanation for why you feel you would benefit from the mentoring program</li>
                        <li>A list of all co-authors and whether they've published at ASSETS before
                            <ul><li>If so, the types of publications (e.g. full paper, poster, etc.)</li></ul>

                    </ol></p>
                    <p>After we introduce you and your mentor via email, you will need to send your submission to that person and discuss it together, for example, by email or video call.</p>

                    <p>Mentoring is an important process that helps bring new researchers into the ASSETS community.

                    <p>Once we have put the mentor and mentee in touch, they are of course free to choose whatever communication method they prefer. One possibility (that really works, at no cost!) is the following:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The mentee sends the submission by email to the mentor to give her/him/them a chance to read it in advance,</li>
                            <li>The mentor and mentee set up an appointment for a video call by email,</li>
                            <li>The mentee uploads the text to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Doc</a> and shares a link to it with the mentor,</li>
                            <li>At the scheduled time, the mentor and mentee establish the video call and both open the shared file in a web browser.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>That way they can talk about the submission and simultaneously edit it, instantly seeing what the counterpart does – almost as good as meeting face-to-face!</p>

                    <p>Mentoring typically pertains to the process of composing the submission, with at least two communication sessions: one at the beginning and one right before the deadline to submit. After reviews are received, mentees are encouraged to contact their mentor again and seek advice on interpreting the reviewers' comments. Even if the submission is accepted, this final session may help the mentee produce an even better camera-ready version.</p>
