                    <p>Research on accessible and assistive technologies is primarily motivated by the needs of people with disabilities and other stakeholders, like caregivers and educators. Understanding these needs is crucial, but often requires first-hand experience that might be unavailable to all researchers in the community. ASSETS 2022 invites papers that reflect peopleâ€™s experiences with disabilities and the challenges and opportunities related to accessible and assistive technologies. These papers will be reflective in nature and will give authors an opportunity to share their experiences as people with disabilities, caregivers, rehabilitation professionals, educators, researchers, developers, entrepreneurs, or other stakeholders.</p>

                    <p><b>Important information</b>: ACM continues to update the publication process and now paper metadata will be pulled directly from your personal PCS account. This means that it is crucial for you and all of your co-authors to update the contact information so that names, affiliations AND primary email addresses are stylized exactly in the way that you all would want to see them in the ACM digital library and on your paper. For example, if you use a personal email address (xyz123@hotmail.com) as your primary contact email in PCS then this email will appear on your paper. Please <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?next=https%3A//new.precisionconference.com/contact_info">check your author information and make necessary changes</a>.</p>
