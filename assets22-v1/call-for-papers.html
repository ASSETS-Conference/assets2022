                    <p>The ASSETS conference is the premier forum for presenting research on the design, evaluation, use, and education related to computing for people with disabilities and older adults. We invite high-quality original submissions on topics relevant to computing and accessibility.</p>
                    <p>Submissions should present significant contributions to design, systems, tools, scientific understanding, methodology, or social issues. Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) new enabling technologies, studies of how technologies are used by people with disabilities, explorations of barriers to access, and evaluations of accessibility education methods. We recommend that papers with a technical contribution be validated through research activities with representative users when possible. However, we acknowledge that many accessibility-focused projects may begin with deep formative work with representative users, or may be based on prior research with representative users, and as such key contributions of a single paper may be primarily technical.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Authors should refer to the <a href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-writing-guide/" target="_blank">General Writing Guidelines for Technology and People with Disabilities</a> when preparing submissions.
                    </p>
                    <p>All submissions are subject to ACM policies for papers published: As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc" target="_blank">ACM Publications Policies</a>, including ACM's new <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" target="_blank">Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects</a>.</p>

                    <p>Given the hybrid format of the conference, the current expectation is that at least one author from all categories physically present their artifacts in Athens at the conference. In addition, we will ask all authors to prepare prerecorded and captioned videos that will be made available to all attendees (both virtual-only attendees and on-site attendees). If you have disability or health concerns that prevent travel, please contact <a href="mailto:assets22-leadership@acm.org">assets22-leadership@acm.org</a>.</p>

                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Technical papers are expected to present significant and original contributions. For early work and work-in-progress, authors may consider submitting a poster or demo. Papers may expand upon previously published posters or demos, but must present novel and significantly extended content, and should cite any previous abstracts for posters or demos. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview" target="_blank">ACM policy on plagiarism</a> for guidance.</p>

                    <p>All Technical Papers and Posters and Demonstrations submissions are peer-reviewed by an international <!--<a href="program-committee.html">-->Program Committee<!--</a>-->. Accepted papers and the abstracts for posters and demonstrations, experience reports, and the student research competition will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of accepted submissions must register as the presenter by the early registration deadline.</p>

                    <p>As in previous years, ASSETS will present a Best Paper Award, for the best overall paper submitted to the conference, as well as a Best Student Paper Award, for a paper primarily authored by a student.</p>
                    <p>ASSETS will also present a Best Artifact Award, for a paper, poster, or demo that relates to the best publicly released artifact, such as an application or commercial product. This award will go to work that has the greatest potential for impact in the real world for end users, developers, or researchers. This award will be attached to existing submission types; during submission of a paper, poster, or demo, you will be given the opportunity to include a link to a publicly available artifact that relates to that work.</p>
                    <p>The awards details are available on the <a href="comingsoon.html">Awards page</a>.</p>
