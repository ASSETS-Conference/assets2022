                    <p>The Poster and Demonstration Session is an opportunity for presenting late-breaking results, ongoing research projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. This session is an ideal platform for researchers and practitioners to present their work, engage in discussion regarding their work and receive valuable feedback. Participants are invited to submit high-quality posters and demonstrations presenting novel ideas, designs, techniques, systems, tools, evaluations, scientific investigations, methodologies, social issues or policy issues relating to any topics that may be of interest to the accessibility community. A poster is a great way to test new ideas, generate interest in a research area, or describe useful or interesting work that is not substantial enough for a full paper presentation. A demonstration is a great way to communicate inventive accessible computing and IT technologies in action.</p>
                    <p>The submission must clearly demonstrate relevance to accessibility research. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to accessibility, originality, potential significance, topicality and clarity. A detailed list of suggested topics can be found in the <a href="call-for-papers.html">Call for Papers</a>.</p>

                    <h4>Please Note:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This year we are using a single-column submission format, with a maximum of 4 pages + references.</li>
                        <li>Since ASSETS is being held in a hybrid approach, the poster/demos will also be presented both offline and online (subject to change).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>More details on both below.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center" tabindex="0">Submission Guidelines</h3>

                    <p>Poster and demonstration 4-page submission should use a single-column template found in the <a href="submission-templates.html">Submission Templates</a> page. Note that references do not count toward page limits.</p>
                    <p>Submissions (in PDF format) should be submitted by the deadline (<b>TBD</b>).</p>
                    <p>Please note that <b>these are NOT double blind submissions</b>; the authors' names should be on the paper. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by an <a href="#">international panel</a>, per the <a href="policy-on-program-committees.html">ASSETS policy on Program Committees</a>.</p>
                    <p>Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. For accepted posters and demonstrations, at least one author <b>must register</b> as the presenter by the early registration deadline to be included in the proceedings.</p>
                    <p>In addition, <b>after acceptance</b>, authors will be required to prepare a short audio speech file describing the content of their physical posters. This feature makes posters more accessible to blind and low vision attendees.</p>

                    <h4>Accessible Submissions</h4>
                    <h5>Accessible PDFs</h5>
                    <p>Your PDF file must be accessible. Please refer to the instructions on <a href="https://assets21.sigaccess.org/creating_accessible_pdfs.html">Creating an Accessible ACM Conference Paper</a> for information on how to accomplish this. If you cannot create an accessible PDF at submission time then you will be given the option to upload either an accessible HTML or Microsoft Word version of your paper in addition to your PDF to facilitate review. If your paper is accepted, the final version will need to be transformed into an accessible PDF document.</p>

                    <h5>Writing Guidelines</h5>
                    <p>Writing Guidelines are available to help authors choose appropriate language for <a href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-writing-guide/">writing about technology and people with disabilities</a>. Finally, please refer to the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism">ACM policy on plagiarism</a> for guidance.</p>

                    <p><b>Important information</b>: ACM continues to update the publication process and now paper metadata will be pulled directly from your personal PCS account. This means that it is crucial for you and all of your co-authors to update the contact information so that names, affiliations AND primary email addresses are stylized exactly in the way that you all would want to see them in the ACM digital library and on your paper. For example, if you use a personal email address (xyz123@hotmail.com) as your primary contact email in PCS then this email will appear on your paper. Please <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?next=https%3A//new.precisionconference.com/contact_info">check your author information and make necessary changes</a>.</p>
