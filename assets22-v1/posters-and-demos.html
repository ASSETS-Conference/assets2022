                    <p>The Poster and Demonstration Session is an opportunity for presenting late-breaking results, ongoing research
                        projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. This session is an ideal platform for researchers and
                        practitioners to present their work, engage in discussion regarding their work, and receive valuable feedback.
                        Participants are invited to submit high-quality posters and demonstrations presenting novel ideas, designs,
                        techniques, systems, tools, evaluations, scientific investigations, methodologies, social issues or policy issues
                        relating to any topics that may interest the accessibility community. A poster is a great way to test new ideas,
                        generate interest in a research area, or describe useful or interesting work that is not substantial enough for a
                        full paper presentation. A demonstration is a great way to communicate inventive accessible computing and IT
                        technologies in action.</p>
                    <p>The submission must clearly demonstrate relevance to accessibility research. Decisions about acceptance will be based
                        on relevance to accessibility, originality, potential significance, topicality and clarity. A detailed list of
                        suggested topics can be found in the <a href="call-for-papers.html">Call for Papers</a>.</p>
                    <p>Given the hybrid format of the conference, the current expectation is that at least one author from all categories
                        physically present their artifacts in Athens at the conference. In addition, we will ask all authors to prepare
                        prerecorded and captioned videos that will be made available to all attendees (both virtual-only attendees and
                        on-site attendees). If you have disability or health concerns that prevent travel, please contact
                        <a href="mailto:assets22-leadership@acm.org">assets22-leadership@acm.org</a>.</p>

                    <p>Poster and demonstration submissions should be 4,000 to 5,000 words and use a single-column template found in the
                        <a href="submission-templates.html">Submission Templates</a> page. Submissions should be in PDF format. References do not
                        count toward word limits.
                    </p>
                    <p>We will use a fully-anonymous review process for Posters and Demos, in which the <b>authors must anonymize their
                            paper
                            submissions and all supplemental materials.</b> All submissions will be peer-reviewed by an <!--<a
                            href="comingsoon.html">-->international panel<!--</a>-->, per the
                        <a href="policy-on-committees.html">ASSETS policy on Program Committees</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. For accepted posters and demonstrations, at
                        least one author <b>must register</b> as the presenter by the early registration deadline to be included in the
                        proceedings.</p>
                    <p>After acceptance, authors will be required to prepare a short video (e.g., 90 seconds) with a subtitles file (e.g.,
                        an .srt) describing the content of their physical posters. This feature makes physical posters more accessible to
                        everyone.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Accessible Submissions</h4>
                    <p>Your PDF file must be accessible. Please refer to the instructions on <a href="creating-accessible-pdfs.html">Creating an
                        Accessible ACM Conference Paper</a> for information on how to accomplish this. If you cannot create an accessible PDF
                        at submission time then you will be given the option to upload either an accessible HTML or Microsoft Word version of
                        your paper in addition to your PDF to facilitate review. If your paper is accepted, the final version will need to be
                        transformed into an accessible PDF document.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Writing Guidelines</h4>
                    <p>Writing Guidelines are available to help authors choose appropriate language for

                    <h4>Poster Presentation</h4>
                    <p>ASSETS is being held in a hybrid format this year, but at least one author needs to physically attend the conference.
                        We are still designing how the posters and demo sessions will run, with a view to making the sessions as accessible
                        and engaging as possible for in-person and remote attendees alike. Please check back for details in due course.</p>
                    <p>If you have any special requests, please contact Hugo Nicolau and Taslima Akter at <a href="mailto:poster-demo-assets22@acm.org">poster-demo-assets22@acm.org</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h4>IMPORTANT - Author PCS Account Details</h4>
                    <p>ACM continues to update the publication process and now paper metadata will be pulled directly from your personal PCS
                        account. This means that it is crucial for you and all of your co-authors to update the contact information so that
                        names, affiliations AND primary email addresses are stylized exactly in the way that you all would want to see them
                        in the ACM digital library and on your paper. For example, if you use a personal email address (xyz123@hotmail.com)
                        as your primary contact email in PCS then this email will appear on your paper. Please <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?next=https%3A//new.precisionconference.com/contact_info">
                        check your author information and make necessary changes</a>.</p>
