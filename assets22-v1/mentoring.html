                    <p>Help from seasoned researchers is available through the ASSETS Mentoring Program. You may receive advice on a submission in any of the submission categories provided by ASSETS. If you think you would benefit from mentoring because you are new to presenting your research, new to the type of category you would like to submit to, or simply find preparing an English-language or accessible paper to be difficult, please consider applying for mentoring help.</p>

                    <p>
                        Mentoring typically pertains to the process of composing the submission, with at least two communication sessions: one at the beginning and one right before the deadline to submit. After reviews are received, mentees are encouraged to contact their mentor again and seek advice on interpreting the reviewers' comments. Even if the submission is accepted, this final session may help the mentee produce an even better camera-ready version.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mentors provide feedback to authors on a draft of their paper and particularly highlight how an ASSETS paper could differ from other conferences in expectations. Mentors are not co-authors on the paper, their role is to provide advice during the writing process. Mentoring is not a pre-requisite for submitting a paper to ASSETS. It is meant to help bring in researchers to our community.
                    </p>

                        Mentoring is an important process that helps bring new researchers into the ASSETS community. Potential mentors should have had at least one accepted paper at past ASSETS and be willing to spend the time as indicated above. If you are interested in being a mentor, please email the mentoring chairs (<a href="mailto:mentoring-assets22@acm.org">mentoring-assets22@acm.org</a>) by <b>February 15, 2022 5pm PST</b>, to indicate your  area of expertise.
                    </p>

                    <h5><b>Suggested Communication Process</b></h5><p> </p>

                    <p>Once we have put the mentor and mentee in touch, they are of course free to choose whatever communication method they prefer. One possibility (that really works, at no cost!) is the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The mentee sends the submission by email to the mentor to give her/him/them a chance to read it in advance,</li>
                        <li>The mentor and mentee set up an appointment for a video call by email,</li>
                        <li>The mentee uploads the text to a <a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank">Google Doc</a> and shares a link to it with the mentor,</li>
                        <li>At the scheduled time, the mentor and mentee establish the video call and both open the shared file in a web browser.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>That way they can talk about the submission and simultaneously edit it, instantly seeing what the counterpart does – almost as good as meeting face-to-face!</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center" tabindex="0">Accessible Submissions Mentorship</h3>
                    <p>Accessibility mentors can answer questions like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How can I ensure that someone using a screen reader can access my manuscript?</li>
                        <li>What makes good alt text to describe figures in my manuscript?</li>
                        <li>What challenges would someone with color-blindness have reading my figures?</li>
                        <li>What precautions must be taken so that screen-readers are compatible with my tables?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Note that this is not a service to make your paper accessible for you, but accessibility mentors will help all authors get the advice and resources they need.</p>

                    <p>It is important to the ASSETS community that the research we produce is accessible to everyone and at every stage of the publication process. However, producing accessible research articles, especially in PDF format, can be challenging. If you are new to this process, refer to the <a href="guidelines-policies.html#a11y-pdfs">instructions on Creating Accessible PDFs</a>.
