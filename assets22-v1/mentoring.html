                    <p>Mentoring is an important process that helps bring new researchers into the ASSETS community and to ensure that papers are accessible to everyone. We have two types of mentorship available: Paper Writing Mentorship and Accessible Submission Mentorship.</p>

                    <p><b>Paper Writing Mentorship:</b> Help from seasoned researchers is available through the ASSETS Mentoring Program. You may receive advice on a submission in any of the submission categories provided by ASSETS. If you think you would benefit from mentoring because you are new to presenting your research, new to the type of category you would like to submit to, or seek assistance in preparing an English-language paper, please consider applying for mentoring help. The deadline to request a Paper Writing Mentor is <b>Tuesday, February 15, 2022</b>.</p>

                    <p><b>Accessible Submissions Mentorship:</b> It is expected that papers will be made accessible both at the time of review and for the final submission. Paper submissions that are not accessible may be desk rejected. If you think you could benefit from a mentor to help you with this writing informative alt tags and making the paper accessible, please consider applying for mentoring help. The deadline to request an Accessible Submission Mentor is <b>Tuesday, March 15, 2022</b>.</p>

                    <p>Participating in the ASSETS Mentoring Program does not guarantee that ASSETS will accept your submission. However, most individuals who have used the mentoring service at ASSETS, or at the CHI conference where it began, have reported positive experiences and an improved understanding of what reviewers require in general.</p>
                    <p>To apply, email the Mentor Chairs, Sayan Sarcar and Kirsten Ellis at <a href="mailto:mentoring-assets22@acm.org">mentoring-assets22@acm.org</a> by the deadlines.</p>
                    <p><ol>
                        <li>A one-page extended abstract of your paper</li>
                        <li>A short explanation for why you feel you would benefit from the mentoring program</li>
                        <li>A list of all co-authors and whether they've published at ASSETS before
                            <ul><li>If so, the types of publications (<i>e.g.,</i> full paper, poster, <i>etc.</i>)</li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>What category you are targeting (<i>e.g.,</i> full paper, poster, <i>etc.</i>)</li>
                    </ol></p>
                    <p>After we introduce you and your mentor via email, you will need to send your submission to that person and discuss it together, for example, by email or video call.</p>

                    <p>Once we have put the mentor and mentee in touch, they are of course free to choose whatever communication method they prefer. One possibility (that really works, at no cost!) is the following:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The mentee sends the submission by email to the mentor to give her/him/them a chance to read it in advance,</li>
                            <li>The mentor and mentee set up an appointment for a video call by email,</li>
                            <li>The mentee uploads the text to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Doc</a> and shares a link to it with the mentor,</li>
                            <li>At the scheduled time, the mentor and mentee establish the video call and both open the shared file in a web browser.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>That way they can talk about the submission and simultaneously edit it, instantly seeing what the counterpart does – almost as good as meeting face-to-face!</p>

                    <p>Mentoring typically pertains to the process of composing the submission, with at least two communication sessions: one at the beginning and one right before the deadline to submit. After reviews are received, mentees are encouraged to contact their mentor again and seek advice on interpreting the reviewers' comments. Even if the submission is accepted, this final session may help the mentee produce an even better camera-ready version.</p>

                    <p>It is important to the ASSETS community that the research we produce is accessible to everyone and at every stage of the publication process. However, producing accessible research articles, especially in PDF format, can be challenging. If you are new to producing accessible documents or are looking for advice on how to make your research more accessible, please contact us to be paired with an accessibility mentor!</p>

                    <p>Accessibility mentors can answer questions like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How can I ensure that someone using a screen reader can access my manuscript?</li>
                        <li>What makes good alt text to describe figures in my manuscript?</li>
                        <li>What challenges would someone with color-blindness have reading my figures?</li>
                        <li>What precautions must be taken so that screen-readers are compatible with my tables?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Note that this is not a service to make your paper accessible for you, but accessibility mentors will help all authors get the advice and resources they need.</p>

Please submit the form below to volunteer to receive questions from other authors. We will work with you to ensure you are paired with only the amount of authors you have time to volunteer for!</p>
