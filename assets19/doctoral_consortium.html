            DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM
        </h1>

        <p>
            The ASSETS 2019 Doctoral Consortium (DC) will be held on <b>Sunday, October 27, 2019</b>, in Pittsburgh, PA with an evening event on <b>Saturday, October 26</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The overarching goal of the consortium is to encourage and prepare a group of promising young researchers dedicated to accessibility and assistive technology by:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Providing PhD students with a supportive forum to submit and receive high-quality feedback about their accessibility-related dissertation work from researchers outside their own institution, including student peers, faculty, and industry professionals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Providing opportunities for participants to network with one another and senior members of the ASSETS community.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enabling the student participants to attend the ASSETS 2019 conference, to contribute to the conference goals through interaction with other researchers and conference events, and to learn of potential career paths within academia and industry.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The DC co-chairs are Professors Jon Froehlich and Amanda Lazar. Please contact them at <a href="mailto:dc-assets19@acm.org">dc-assets19@acm.org</a> with questions or additional information.

            Who Should Apply
        </h2>
       
        <p>
            We encourage doctoral candidates at an early-to-mid stage of their research to apply rather than students who have already made substantial progress towards their dissertation. The DC focuses on earlier-stage students because the goal is to provide feedback that can help guide and shape dissertation research agendas. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Applicants may also submit to the Student Research Competition, but the work described must be different. 
        </p>

            Relevant Topics

        <p>
            Relevant topics for the Consortium are the same as for the conference as a whole.
            See the <a href="call_for_papers.html">Call for Papers</a>.
