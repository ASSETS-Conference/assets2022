            For ASSETS 2019, we are introducing a new category for research that has led to products, apps, or other resources that are available to the public. To acknowledge the importance of getting our research out into society, and the extra work required to do so, SIGACCESS will present the 2019 Artifact Award for research that has reached the public.
        </p>

            Open source projects are eligible if they include appropriate documentation and are presented in a form that can be used by a non-expert computer user.
