            The Poster and Demonstration Session is an opportunity for presenting late-breaking results, ongoing research projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. 
            This session is an ideal platform for researchers and practitioners to present their work, engage in discussion regarding their work and receive valuable feedback. 
            Participants are invited to submit high-quality posters and demonstrations presenting novel ideas, designs, techniques, systems, tools, evaluations, scientific 
            investigations, methodologies, social issues or policy issues relating to any topics that may be of interest to the accessibility community. A poster is a great way to 
            test new ideas, generate interest in a research area, or describe useful or interesting work that is not substantial enough for a full paper presentation or present 
            late-breaking result. A demonstration is a great way to communicate inventive accessible computing and IT technologies in action.
        </p>

        <p>
            The extended abstract must clearly demonstrate relevance to accessibility research. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to accessibility, originality, potential 
            significance, topicality and clarity. A detailed list of suggested topics can be found in the <a href="call_for_papers.html">Call for Papers</a>.

            Submission Guidelines
        </h2>

        <p>
            Poster and demonstration <b>2-page</b> extended abstracts should use templates that can be found in 
            the <a href="submission_templates.html">Submission Templates page</a>. Note that references <u>do not</u> count toward page limits.
        </p>

        <p>
            Submissions (in PDF format) should be submitted by the deadline (<b>Wednesday, July 10, 2019, 5 p.m. PDT</b>). It is important to <b>note that these are NOT double blind submissions; the authors' names should be on the paper</b>. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by an <a href="program_committee.html">international panel</a>, per the <a href="policy_program_committees.html">ASSETS policy on Program Committees</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Accepted extended abstracts will be included in the conference proceedings. For accepted posters and demonstrations, at least 
            one author must register as the presenter by the early registration deadline to be included in the proceedings.
        </p>

        <p id="postera11y">
            <b>NEW*</b> In addition, to make posters accessible to blind and low vision attendees, we are requiring authors to prepare a short audio speech file describing the content of their physical posters. This file along with its text transcript should be uploaded to the Google folder link that was emailed to authors at least three days before the conference, that is, before Friday, Oct 25, 2019, 11:59PM PDT. The recording should be a maximum of 2 mins in length, in .mp3 format, under 15MB, and contain:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Your poster title, authors and affiliation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A short description of your research problem, what you did, what you found and the paths forward -- like what you were going to present to the attendees. Please limit this summary to 2-3 sentences.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Complement the above step 2, with alt text descriptions of any visuals in your poster. This should form the bulk of your audio file.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            Please also upload a written script of your audio description. Feel free to use either a human or an automated speaker, but ensure that your recording is clear and noise free.  These recordings will appear online during the conference and are not part of the proceedings.
