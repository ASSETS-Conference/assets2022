<h5>Transcript of Audio File</h5>
<p>The title of the research poster is Captioning Practices in Deaf Vlogs on YouTube</p>
<p>The authors are Julia Kerns, Elizabeth Beers, Hernisa Kacorri from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD.</p>
<p>This work aims to provide a better understanding of current practices in captioning of Deaf Vlogs in a popular medium such as Youtube. Our observations can have implications for future work in building sign language datasets scrapped from the web. Moreover, they can inform the design of vlogging interfaces by considering the Deaf community’s ownership over signed content in the presence of future auto-translation features. </p>
<p>To collect our data, we used the keyword deaf vlog which we then used to code the top 100 videos however videos were not restricted to a specific sign language. For a video to be included, it had to include sign language content created by Deaf people. </p>
<p>We used several methods in characterizing the videos: 1. Type of Sign Language, 2. types of captioning practices which are none, user-generated closed captions, auto-generated closed captions, open captions, audio, and transcripts, 3. thematic category listed by YouTube, 4. Intended audience, 5. Number of views</p>
<p>We concluded that over 42 of the videos were intended for a Deaf audience. The distribution of the number of views by captioning practices was higher throughout the videos containing closed captioning and audio. These results provide us with the understanding that there is more work to be done on creating datasets to analyze the various types of captioning and various types of sign language used in these videos. This information will provide us with a foundational start to begin indexing Deaf Vlogs for future technologies. Thank you.</p>

<p>IMPACT OF ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES IN SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA</p>
<p>Dr. Ikram Asghar</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Due to ageing, global dementia population has reached over 50 million. The use of assistive technologies has the potential to help them. </p>
<p>However, these technologies have high abandonment rate due to challenges like user friendliness, social isolation and participatory design.</p>
<p>Aims and Objectives</p>
<p>This study aims at empirically evaluating the impacts of assistive technology to support the people with dementia. The research objectives are: </p>
<p>Investigate existing assistive technologies </p>
<p>Identify important factors </p>
<p>Elicit requirements</p>
<p>Design and development new technology </p>
<p>Impact experiments</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>This study used mixed research methodology approach. Secondary research methods including literature review and systematic mapping. </p>
<p>Primary research methods including interviews, questionnaires and case studies. </p>
<p>Proposed Solution</p>
<p>Developed an Assistive Brotherhood Community Software Application</p>
<p>Conducted eight case studies involving 8 dementia people and 40 volunteers</p>
<p>People with dementia got their needed items quickly and in friendlier manner through the help of volunteers</p>
<p>The involvement of the caregivers for medication, meals, and prayers reduced significantly</p>
<p>The painting function evoked memories and improved motivation</p>
<p>The news and weather functions kept updated </p>
<p>The travel tutor guided in safe travel outside home and made sure that they get back independently</p>
<p>Research Contributions and Impacts</p>
<p>Largest study globally to involve the 347 people with dementia</p>
<p>First usability evaluation study in South Asia</p>
<p>National dementia strategy help for developing countries</p>
<p>First day care centre at Pakistan</p>
<p>Six journal and three conference publications</p>
<p>Future Work</p>
<p>Planning to implement Assistive Brotherhood Communities in Western Countries.</p>
