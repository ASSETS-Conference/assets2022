            CALL FOR PAPERS
        </h1>
        
        <p>
            The ASSETS conference is the premier forum for presenting research on the design, evaluation, use, and education related to computing for people with disabilities and older adults. We invite high-quality original submissions on topics relevant to computing and accessibility. 
        </p>

        <p>
            For the first time, ASSETS is expanding its scope this year to include original high-quality research on topics related to education of computing accessibility. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Submissions should present significant contributions to design, systems, tools, scientific understanding, methodology, or social issues. Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) new enabling technologies, studies of how technologies are used by people with disabilities, explorations of barriers to access, and evaluations of accessibility education methods. It is expected that, in most cases, a paper’s research contributions will be validated through research activities conducted within the target user groups. Papers that include a technical contribution without being validated through research activities with representative users are unlikely to be accepted.
        </p>

        <p>
            Authors should refer to the <a href="http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/november-december-2015/writing-about-accessibility" target="_blank">General Writing Guidelines for Technology and People with Disabilities</a> when preparing submissions.
        </p>

            Technical papers are expected to present significant and original contributions. For early work and work-in-progress, authors may consider submitting a poster or demo. Papers may expand upon previously published posters or demos, but must present novel and significantly extended content, and should cite any previous abstracts for posters or demos. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy" target="_blank">ACM policy on plagiarism</a> for guidance.
        </p>

        <p>
            All contributions are peer-reviewed by an international <a href="program_committee.html">Program Committee</a>. Accepted papers and the abstracts for posters and demonstrations, experience reports, and the student research competition will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of accepted submissions must register as the presenter by the early registration deadline. 

        </p>

        <p>
            <b>AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:</b> The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

           Awards
        </h2>

        <p>
            As in previous years, ASSETS will present a <a href="awards.html#Best_Paper_Award">Best Paper Award</a>, for the best overall paper submitted to the conference, as well as a <a href="awards.html#Best_Student_Paper_Award">Best Student Paper Award</a>, for a paper primarily authored by a student.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the first time, ASSETS will also present a <a href="awards.html#Best_Artifact_Award">Best Artifact Award</a>, for a paper, poster, or demo that relates to the best publicly released artifact, such as an application or commercial product. This award will go to work that has the greatest potential for impact in the real world for end users, developers, or researchers. This award will be attached to existing submission types; during submission of a paper, poster, or demo, you will be given the opportunity to include a link to a publicly available artifact representing that relates to that work.
