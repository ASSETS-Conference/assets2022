Building Capacity: eTextile Tactile StoryBook Workshops
By Leona Holloway, Kirsten Ellis and Louise Curtin (Monash University) 
Tactile literacy is a key to success, and the first step is active touch stimulated by engaging tactile diagrams. 
eTextiles offer an easy and affordable means of enhancing tactile story book pages. We used Lilypad components, conductive thread, LED lights and vibration motors. 
We ran three public workshops, each with up to 23 adults and children. After a brief explanation and exposure to sample materials, participants were supported to create their own story book page with a sewn circuit. Everyone was able to complete the task within the 2-3 hour workshop, and a surprising number incorporated switches for greater interactivity.  
Based on our experiences, we offer seven guiding principles for running Tactile eTextile Workshops: 
1. Get people making as quickly as possible; 
2. Provide Inspirational materials such as rhymes and picture story books;
3. Provide examples of the finished product;
4. Encourage people to check their work by touch;
5. Keep it simple for success, starting with a very simple circuit;
6. Intervene early with a higher ratio of helpers; and 
7. Use collaborative learning.
