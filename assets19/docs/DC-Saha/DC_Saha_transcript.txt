Poster titled “Interactive Computational Tools for Assessing and Understanding Urban Accessibility at Scale”

My name is Manaswi Saha, a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. My research is looking into the problem of understanding urban accessibility at scale. Urban accessibility is about the ease of walking/rolling around the cities to get to destinations for pedestrians, especially for people with mobility disabilities. My thesis is around building interactive tools that will help develop a deeper understanding of urban accessibility such that the tools can help (1) Increase transparency and accountability from cities, (2) Facilitate evidence-based decision making, and (3) Foster civic engagement and advocacy. My thesis is divided into three parts: first looks into the problem of scalably collecting accessibility data for sidewalks; second, looks into developing a deep understanding of the problem domain by talking to several stakeholder groups in addition to people with disabilities and their caregivers. They are elected officials, transportation departments, and accessibility advocates. Finally, I will look into building an interactive visual geo-analytics tool that will help aid in answering questions around the current state of accessibility.
