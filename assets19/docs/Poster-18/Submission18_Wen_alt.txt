This poster has six figures. Three figures illustrate how math work feels like for students with SLDs. Students with dyslexia can see digits upside-down. Students with dyscalculia are frequently uncertain about the meaning of math symbols. Students with dysgraphia might forget how to write math symbols. We used a screenshot of Khan Academy to highlight math e-learning tool features that are reported to be difficult for students with SLDs. Khan Academy is an example of online math e-learning tools used by our participants. Our participants reported that (1) these tools canâ€™t help students visualize math concepts because they are all text-based. (2) students have trouble typing math work. (3) These tools do not report to our participants when and why students get stuck. We showed two pictures of manipulatives that our participants preferred to use for students with SLDs: (1) a number line that can visualize whole-number addition and (2) different sizes of fraction tiles to help students compare fractions.
