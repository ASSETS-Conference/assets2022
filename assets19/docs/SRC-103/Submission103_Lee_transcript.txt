Intelligent Decision Support for Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment

Rehabilitation assessment is important to determine personalized intervention for post-stroke survivors. 
However, assessment relies on therapist's subjective knowledge and is infrequently executed due to the limited availability of therapists. 

This research presents an interactive multimodal approach that augments data-driven model with therapist's knowledge for personalized rehabilitation assessment.
This approach first automatically identifies salient features to predict the quality of motion and generate user-specific analysis to provide insights on patient's performance.
After reviewing user-specific analysis, therapists can provide feature-based feedback on each patient to iteratively update an assessment model. 

For the evaluation, the dataset of three upper-limb exercises is collected from 15 post-stroke and 11 healthy subjects, which are annotated by two therapists.
Five therapists participated to provide 9 feature-based feedback on each patient.

While accommodating therapist's feedback, a generic model is tuned to a personalized model, which improves agreement with therapist's evaluation from 0.83 to 0.91 average F1-scores. 
Specifically, an interactive model achieves significantly better agreement with therapist's evaluation than average therapist's agreement levels and non-interactive models.

This result describes the importance of an interactive approach to augment therapist's feedback for more accurate and personalized rehabilitation assessment.
In future, we plan to evaluate the effectiveness of user-specific analysis to provide insights on patient's performance for therapists and corrective feedback for post-stroke subjects.
