The figure at the middle section of the poster describes the flow diagram and visualization interface of the presented approach.
The presented approach first automatically identifies the salient features to derive a data-driven, prediction model for assessment.
The visualization interace presents user-specific analysis with the predicted quality of motion, three salient feature values on unaffected and affected side, buttons to collect therapist's feature-based feedback.
After reviewing user-specific analysis, a therapist can provide feature-based feedback to update rule-based Knowledge Model.
This upated rule-based Knowledge and data-driven model are integrated into an interactive Multimodal using a weighted average.

The figure at the botton left describes an example of feature-based rules from a therapists, which checks whether a wrist joint is placed higher than subject's top of spine joint. 
Three figures at the botton right describe the results of the presented approach.
The first figure describes the validation of feature selection: the presented approach can increase correct prediction while reducing the number of features for assessment.
The second figure shows that the presented interactive approach increases its performance while accomodating therapist's feature-based feedback over 10 iterations.
The third  figure summarizes the performance of the presented interactive approach outperformed non-interactive approach and therapist's agreement level.
