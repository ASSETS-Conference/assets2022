The second and final stage is routine execution by users with some assistance using planners, digital assistants, reminders, and schedulers. One stage that's missing and could help is routine practice.  Figure 2 displays a storyboard of an example scenario, where a user is using an augmented reality game to learn about recycling a bottle.
