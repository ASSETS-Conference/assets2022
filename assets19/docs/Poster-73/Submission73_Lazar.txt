In this poster, we describe the approach used at the University of Maryland College Park to introduce accessibility content into the undergraduate “User-Centered Design” (Fall 2018) course by including accessibility concepts into the four currently taught modules i.e., 1) web design, 2) understanding user needs, 3) prototyping, and 4) evaluation.We added accessible web design i.e., Web content accessibility guidelines to web design module, described contextual inquiry, disability and assumptions in understanding user needs module by giving an example of a failed design due to mistaken assumptions, taught about personas and implicit bias, and how different disabilities and accessibility considerations can be incorporated into personas in the designing and prototyping module, and stressed on accessibility evaluations by simulating disability in class and using W3C tools to evaluate the accessibility of website in the evaluation module. After piloting the above modules in Fall 2018, we updated the modules by merging content and adding more content on WCAG, accessibility guidelines for non-web content, algorithmic bias and organizational inclusion of people with disabilities in design. This was rolled out in Spring 2019 and continues to be taught in all sections of this course. To assess how the course modules affected students’ understanding of accessibility, we administered a survey including Likert scale questions related to current knowledge of accessibility and interest in learning about developing technology for people with disabilities. Results indicate that the averaged scores of each student’s responses for the post-survey were significantly higher than the pre-survey scores. Future work needs to assess the perceptions and changes in student understanding at a larger scale.
