Our research goal is to build an accessible technology for older adults that supports the independent and collaborative learning of smart devices for personal health management. We developed Help Kiosk 2.0 that integrates instructions, videos, and feedback into a single 40” tabletop display on which users are able to place their smart devices. From prior work, we derived three design requirements for our system: known guidelines for senior-friendly instructions; onboarding and personal health management; and collaborative learning and social connectedness. The core features of our system are a remote video support feature (Help) integrated with Zoom; a navigation menu for eight key learning topics; and the central area where the devices (smartwatch and tablet) are placed and instructional information (text, images, and videos) display. Our next step is to conduct video prototype interviews and observational studies to evaluate the system with older adults so that we can iterate on the design and make modifications to improve their learning experiences of smart devices.
