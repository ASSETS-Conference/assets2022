Twitter A11y is a browser extension that makes images on Twitter accessible. 
Currently only 0.1% of images on Twitter have alt text. 
Twitter A11y adds alt text to images on Twitter using two components: the extension and the server. 
As the user browses their Twitter timeline, the Twitter A11y browser extension scrapes URLs of images without alt text and sends them to the server. 
Once the server receives a tweet image, the server classifies what type of image it is in order to choose the best way to create alt text. 
If the image came from a news article, we use a technique called url following that searches the original news page for visually similar images with alt text. 
If the image is classified as text, then we put the image through Google Cloud Visionâ€™s optical character recognition. 
Finally, if the image is not a news article or primarily text, then we obtain alt text using Amazon Mechanical Turk. 
After the server receives alt text, the server sends the new alt text to the extension and Twitter A11y updates the image tag HTML with the generated alt text.
