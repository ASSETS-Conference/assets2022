"Neurodiverse Socio-Technical Collaboration: 
Supporting Sensory-Social-Emotional Styles of Autistic Adults"

My name is Annuska Zolyomi and my research explores the dynamics of neurodiverse collaborators, meaning those who are autistic and non-autistic. This research examines opportunities for technology to increase the agency of autistic adults by taking into account their particular sensory, social, and emotional styles.

To engage with the autism community, I am using a framework called "Community Based Participatory Research." My methodology is grounded design, which is comprised of contextual inquiry, co-design, and appropriation of design artifacts.

An emerging contribution of this research is a theoretical concept that technologies aiming to be emotionally-aware (such as artificial intelligence) also need to be sensory aware. My research will also contribute design guidelines and design domains for creating neurodiverse socio-technical communication tools.
