Audio description (AD) is an accessibility service that provides an alternative to obtaining visual information for blind or visually impaired individuals. AD for scripted live performances, such as musical theater, provides spoken, real-time visual information for blind or visually-impaired theatergoers.

Unlike fixed media, live, repeatable performances cannot have a single, fixed AD track aligned in advance, since repeated live performances are by design never identical. In these cases, AD tracks are pre-recorded and then triggered at the correct moment using some automated process.

AD for live events is expensive and time-consuming to produce, and is rarely available. When it is available, it is often limited to certain performances. Our solution allows AD to be deployed automatically at every performance of a repeated live show using a reference audio recording and online time warping.

We first obtain a complete recording of the show to be described. Concurrently, a live describer describes the show, noting the sample number where each described event begins. On subsequent performances, the pre-recorded AD is triggered based on its location in the reference recording.
