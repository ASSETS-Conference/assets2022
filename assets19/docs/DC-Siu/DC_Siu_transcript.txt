Affordable rapid 3D printing technologies have become key enablers of the Maker Movement by giving individuals the ability to create physical finished products. However, existing computer-aided design (CAD) tools that allow authoring and editing of 3D models are mostly visually reliant and limit access to people with blindness and visual impairment (BVI). In my thesis, I outline three areas of research that I'm conducting towards my PhD thesis towards the goal of  bridging a gap between blind and sighted makers. 
The broad research questions I seek to answer are: 
1. How can complex 3D information be effectively encoded through tactile representations?
2. What are the interaction techniques necessary to create and manipulate 3D models on tactile displays with limited resolution? and 
3. How does access to 3D design and printing in the wild for BVI people change their self efficacy of making and their attitudes towards STEM?
So far I have conducted interviews towards understanding accessibility challenges and preliminary studies to understand how multimodal tactile representations can be leveraged to effectively communicate 3D information. And last, I've co-designed a 3D modelling workflow that allows blind and visually impaired users to ideate and desing 3D models by programming and obtaining dynamic tactile feedback through a 2.5D shape display.
