Motivation:
1. An icon of a design drawing in a notebook and caption that reads "Lack of accessible authoring tools reduces agency, availability, and creativity."
2. An icon of a 3D cube and caption that reads "Increasing access to complex spatial information (e.g. 3D models, maps, etc)".
3. Increasing engagement in STEM.

Research Approach - Proposed Workflow:
1. An image of code written with OpenSCAD with caption that reads "CODE: OpenSCAD is used to specify 3D model geometry through code."
2. An image of a users hand touching a mug rendered on a 2.5D shape display with caption that reads: "Render & Verify: Dynamic feedback on a 2.5D shape display is used for previews."
3. An image of a 3D printed cup and caption that reads: "3D Print: After iterative modifications, the model can be 3D printed."

Research Approach - Current Methods to Access 3D Information:
1. An image of a user exploring a 2D raised line drawing of a human cell and caption that reads: "tactile graphics (require training and not efficient)".
2. An image of a user holding a 3D printed cup and caption that reads: "3D models (slow and domain-knowledge)".

Research Approach - Evaluation:
1. An image showing 3D models that blind users created in an evaluation. From left to right: P1 created a "staircase stand" (15.42 minutes). P2 created a "tall glass cup" (18.78 minutes). P3 created a "truck with carriage" (21.09 minutes). P4 created "a cube with a dome on top" (12.84 minutes). P5 created "a cylinder cup" (8.01 minutes).

Research Approach - Hardware:
1. An image of the designed 2.5D shape display. It consists of a grid of 12x24 pins with motors at the base that actuate each pin. The image has a zoomed in view of the motors coupled to the pins through a rotating leadscrew.
