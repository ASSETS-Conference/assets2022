Still Not Readable? An Interactive Tool for Recommending Color Pairs with Sufficient Contrast based on Existing Visual Designs

What is the problem?
Too little contrast: Visual stimuli are based on differences in light. Many websites have insufficient contrast between the text and its background. This makes text difficult to read under unfavorable lighting conditions, with dim displays or glossy displays with glare, with low visual acuity or with color vision deficiencies. More contrast is also needed with smaller fonts compared to text with larger fonts.

Current tools provide no solutions: Current tools tell designers if their color choices provide enough contrast or not. If not enough contrast the tools do not give any clues as how to fix the problems. Contrast requirements are mathematical and employ trial and error until they achieve sufficient contrast.

What is our solution?
We developed a browser-based tool to help designers correct their color choices based on existing designs. The users simply make an initial mockup of their design, then uploads a snippet of the design to the tool. The tool analyses the color profile and automatically detects of there is too little contrast between a pair of colors. Moreover, the tool suggests how these colors can be correct to achieve enough contrast while maintaining the visual profile of the design.
How did we do it?

We assume that the hues choices are what is most significant for the perception of a visual design. The hues are therefore not altered. Instead we search the color space for the closest points with intensities and saturation levels that gives the resulting color pair sufficient contrast.
 
Try it!
