The Design Challenge
- Inclusiveness: The app should be easy to learn and use for children with and without visual impairments.
- Entertaining: Besides allowing the user to practice literacy skills, the app should also be entertaining.
- Independence: The app should be usable by all users without requiring support from other people.
- Consistency: Key interaction elements should always be in the same area, close to the screen borders.
- Beyond tap: The app should use and teach common interaction gestures to children (Drag & Drop).
- Scalable: It should be possible to add new exercises and content with limited development effort.

The technical challenge
- App developed with ReactNative, a cross-platform developing tool
- WordMelodies runs:
-- on iOS and Android
-- on smartphones and tablets
- Additional issues need to be addressed to make the app accessible on both platforms:
-- one accessibility problem still remains: tab order on iOS
