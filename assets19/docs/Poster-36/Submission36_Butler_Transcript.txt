This poster is titled “A Closer Look: Multi-Sensory Accessible Art Translations”. It presents a collaboration between researchers from Monash University and the Bendigo Art Gallery in Australia, exploring the use of new technologies such as Laser Scanning and 3D printing to create multi-sensory accessible version of gallery artworks.

The poster is made up of 3 main panels. The first panel is named “Background”. It briefly describes the Bendigo Art Gallery, and shows a picture of two visitors at the gallery, viewing a large sculpture titled “Conjurer 3”.

The second panel is the largest of the three and is titled “Artworks and their Translations”. It shows 6 artworks from the permanent collection of the Bendigo Art Gallery that were chosen to explore new accessible translations. The artworks shown are “The Drover” by Walter Withers , “i ate the rainbow up... ... ...” by Del Kathryn Barton, “Happy Ending?” by Michael Doolan,  “Circe” by Bertram Mackennal , “The Young Family” by Patricia Piccinini, and “Conjurer III” by Benjamin Armstrong. These works are described in the accompanying image description text file.

This panel also shows some of the alternate translations that were made of these artworks. They include 3D printed and laser-cut translations.

The final panel is named “Evaluation” and briefly describes the evaluation that took place. It also has a photo of a participant handling a small 3D printed version of “Conjurer 3”.

The poster concludes with the copyright information for the artworks as well as logos for the principle research partners: Bendigo Art Gallery, Monash University, and the SensiLab research lab.
