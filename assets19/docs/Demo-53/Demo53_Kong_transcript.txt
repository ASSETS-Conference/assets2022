We present the demo of Supporting Older Adults in Using Complex User Interfaces with Augmented Reality, authored by Junhan Kong, Anhong Guo, and Jeffrey P. Bigham from Carnegie Mellon University. 


Using complex interfaces has been shown to be challenging for older adults. Existing tutorial systems such as instruction manuals can be cumbersome, and sometimes difficult to use. To solve this problem, we present a system to support older adults in using complex user interfaces by providing step-by-step AR visual guidance and voice feedback. 


Instead of having to explore an unfamiliar interface through trial and error, users can simply select the task to perform from pre-generated action sequences of the interface, such as copying a document on a printer, and then follow the visual and voice guidance to complete it. Using Apple ARKit, our system detects the interface state in the user’s camera view, infers the user’s progress in the selected action sequence, thus displays corresponding visual indicators on the phone screen, and provides voice feedback to guide the users in performing the actions. In the demo, we present an example of how the system guides a user to complete a copying task on a printer through AR visual indicators and voice feedback. 


We ran preliminary user testing with the system, and are currently working on making state detection more accurate and improving the visual indicators and voice feedback to better guide the users.
