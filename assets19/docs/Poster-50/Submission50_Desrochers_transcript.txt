This work is Titled “Evaluation of Why Individuals with ADHD Struggle to Find Effective Digital Time Management Tools” by Breanna Desrochers, Ella Tuson, and John Magee from Clark University in the United States.

Our work investigated the use of time management tools among adults with ADHD with the goal of determining where there may be room for improvement in current digital tools. We present findings from a survey of adults with and without ADHD. Our findings indicate dissatisfaction among adults with ADHD with the tools currently available to them and highlight key areas for potential development. Future work in this area includes expanding digital tools, and conducting more research about balancing multiple time management strategies and the use of timers among those with ADHD.
