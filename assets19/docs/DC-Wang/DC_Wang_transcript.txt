This is a description for an ASSETS 2019 Doctoral Consortium poster for Investigating Accessibility in the Writing Process with Dyslexic Adults by Emily Q. Wang at Northwestern University. 

In this poster, I'm presenting ideas for my ongoing work on designing assistive writing tools for people with dsylexia. Dyslexia is a learning disability or learning difference that impacts how the brain processes language. Dyslexic people are known for being great at brainstorming and analysis, but they have a tendency to have a lot of ideas going at once, wander on tangents, and experience working memory overload while they're trying to write. This means it can be an additional challenge to get their papers to be organized and flow well. Unfortunately, help with structuring arguments and improving the flow of a paper is not the scope of status-quo assistive technology and accommodations, and the blank slate designs of mainstream word processors like Microsoft Word and Google Docs lack features for helping users self-assess written argument structures. In order to address some of these challenges, Iâ€™m prototyping writing tools for visualizing & interacting with a document at different levels of granularity. Different levels of granuarlity here could refer to sentences, paragraphs, or the big-picture thesis concepts in a document. I'm currently developing these tools, engaging in co-design activities with dyslexic undergraduate and graduate students at my research institution, and figuring out how to evaluate my prototypes either in lab settings or for longer-term naturalistic deployment. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts if you're interested or have any questions! My email is eqwang@u.northwestern.edu if you'd like to chat.
