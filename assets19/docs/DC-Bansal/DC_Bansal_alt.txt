Aim and Background
1. A boy looking at a equation and thinking "How will the screen reader read?" and "How complicated it will be for a person with dyslexia to comprehend?"

Research Paradigm
1. A block diagram showing Complexity parameters and associated weights, User characteristics, and Contextual semantics as input to the Equation cognitive complexity system. The output of this system is Delivery mechanism.

Methodology
1. A diagram showing various cognitive complexity parameters (such as time taken, thinking time, number of attempts, types of mistakes, and number of mistakes) and structural complexity parameters (such as height, weight, total number of nodes, max number of children of a node, and types of operators in the equation). A arrow connecting both types of parameters showing that we are working on finding the relationship between them.

2. A 1-D graph with cognitive complexity on the axis. A threshold level is marked to represent classification of equations into simple and complex.
