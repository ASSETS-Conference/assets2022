Transcript of audio file.Typically, the use of touchscreen devices to perceive graphical information by individuals who are blind or visually impaired uses a single exploring finger, with tactile and/or auditory feedback. The main question asked in this study is whether the use of feedback for multiple exploring fingers can improve performance. For tactile feedback, a vibrator was placed on the distal part of one or more fingers to provide feedback for that particular finger. For auditory feedback, grouping principles of both timbre and/or spatial location were used to signal information about one or more exploring fingers through binaural headphones. Seven different methods in total were compared through a within subject design. Blind or visually impaired participants were asked to answer questions about maps of a botanical garden. Performance was determined in terms of the number of correct answers and response time. Preliminary results suggest that the use of audio cues, particularly with two fingers, is more effective than using vibrotactile feedback, whether with one or two fingers.
