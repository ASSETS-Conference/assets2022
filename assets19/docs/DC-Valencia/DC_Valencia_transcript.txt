My name is Stephanie Valencia and my research is on Agency in Augmentative and alternative Communication or AAC. Augmented communicators use AAC devices to speak. My research examines how their partners impact their agency and how we can design tools inspired by these partner interactions.

My work also aims to increase augmented communicatorsâ€™ agency in the design process through participatory design workshops. These workshops will inform the design of the tools and also generate design guidelines on making participatory design accessible for augmented communicators.
