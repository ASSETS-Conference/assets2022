Poster title: Agency in Augmentative and Alternative Communication
A poster for the Doctoral Consortium at Assets 2019 by Stephanie Valencia.
The first image shows a conversation between three people sitting at the table. The first one located on the left is the close conversation partner. Next to him we find  the augmented communicator and on the far right is the third party that in this case is the researcher.
The section titled “Understanding Agency” is accompanied by a diagram showing how the cost of communication between the close conversation partner, the augmented communicator and the third party is unequal and unbalanced. Arrows connecting the three participants vary in weight showing that the effort, or cost, required to communicate along the pathways (arrow thickness) is different depending on who addresses who. For example, if the augmented communicator wants to respond to a question posed by the third party , time-sensitive conversational constraints e.g., replying fast while it is still relevant) can encourage communication along the lowest cost paths (lower width arrows) encouraging communication via their close conversation partner rather than direct augmented communicator to third party communication.
The next section of the poster is titled “Increasing agency in conversation” and is illustrated with three circles with images inside. The first one, located on the left, shows a monitor with the word “device” under the image. The second one shows a person’s silhouette with the word “Partners”. The third circle, located on the right contains the image of a house and a conversation balloon, this figure is labelled “social environment”.
The last section of the poster is titled “Increasing agency in the design process”. This is illustrated with an image that shows a meeting where four people are watching a woman  pointing at some post-its on a wall as if they were in a brainstorming session.
