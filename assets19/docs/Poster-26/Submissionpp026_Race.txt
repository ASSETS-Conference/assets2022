Tactile Schematics: Circuit Accessibility in a Physical Computing ClassAuthors and Affiliations:* Lauren Race, New York University* Chancey Fleet, New York Public Library* Joshua A. Miele, Blind Arduino Project* Tom Igoe, New York University* Amy Hurst, New York UniversityProblem: Schematics are a visual language, describing the relationships between components in an electronic circuit. They present accessibility challenges for tactile learners.Obstacle: Circuit diagrams contain small elements, complex relationships, and must follow industry standards.Solution: An improved set of tactile schematic symbols and nine guidelines to create readable tactile graphics for schematics.Method: Iterative design activities with tactile graphic experts, blind and low vision students, graphic designers, and physical computing instructors.[Image: Tactile graphic of Analog In before the schematic redesign.]Analog In Original: * Components that are too small and close together* There’s no braille labels* Some lines are gray and will not puff up in the fuser[Image: Tactile graphic of Analog In after the schematic redesign.]Analog In 11th Version: * Optimal symbol sizing* Braille labeling* 2-point dotted leader lines* 2-point connection lines* 8-point stroke around Integrated CircuitsTactileschematics.comAcknowledgements: Our Participants, Andrew Heiskell Braille & Talking Book Library, NYU Ability Project, NYU ITP [Image: NYU Ability Project logo and NYU ITP logo]
