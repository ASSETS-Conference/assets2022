Child speech therapy games would benefit from including speech recognition technology to automatically process utterances. However, few studies have examined applying ASR to disordered speech from children, partially due to very limited available data from this population. In our study, we examined two low-resource approaches for domain-specific speech recognition: template matching and adapting existing acoustic models using two standard methods. We found that template matching worked well, but applying maximum a posteriori adaptation to an existing model resulted in the best recognition overall. These results suggest that ASR performance can be improved to a level where it could be used in speech therapy games for children.
