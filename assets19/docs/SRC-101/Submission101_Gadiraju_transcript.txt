Braille literacy has been found to increase chances of employment and improve literacy skills, such as reading comprehension and proficiency. However, the complexity and quantity of content can make learning Braille tedious and discouraging. Current Braille education tools lack interactivity, creating a potentially isolating learning experience. To help create an engaging and collaborative experience while learning Braille, we developed BrailleBlocks. 

BrailleBlocks is a smart, tangible block set that supports interactive games by tracking blocks and providing feedback. Each block in the set represents a single braille cell. Users can place pegs in the blockâ€™s holes to create Braille letters. The system also includes a web-application with educational games for a sighted collaborator to play, support, and learn Braille with a visually impaired child. The system uses computer vision to identify the location of the pegs to determine the Braille letter. Once the system has determined the letters the blocks spell, the system displays the letters on the interface. 

We conducted user studies to test BrailleBlocks with sighted parents and visually impaired children. Parents were excited to interactively guide their child through hand-over-hand touch, often used the system as a spelling practice tool, and lauded the system as a tool to help their child work on reasoning and deduction skills. Children also used the system creatively for building and storytelling. In the future, I will develop BrailleBlocks to become a permanent installation in specialized classrooms by building computation into the blocks to reduce the physical setup and moving games to a voice interface so that visually impaired students can play together without relying on a sighted person. 

Thank you!
