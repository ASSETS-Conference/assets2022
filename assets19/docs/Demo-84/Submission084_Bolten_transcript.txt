AccessMap is a city-scale, highly-interactive web map for pedestrians. AccessMap highlights pedestrian-specific environmental features and automatically computes personalized trip plans, and therefore may be suitable for people with limited mobility that need to avoid potential barriers such as steep paths or raised curbs in unfamiliar places. AccessMap emphasizes pedestrian pathways and attributes as a "first-class" member of the transportation network, allowing for fine-grained decision-making that accounts for a wide diversity of pedestrian needs and preferences. At the time of writing, AccessMap supports pedestrian pathways that include sidewalks and street crossings, curb interfaces like curb ramps, flush curbs, or raised curbs, marked or unmarked street crossings, and pathway steepness. In addition to this applied work, we conducted a preliminary user study where users consistently rated AccessMap as useful and personally relevant, particularly compared to alternative maps that target pedestrians.
