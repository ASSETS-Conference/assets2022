We present the demo “GoDonnie A robot programming language to improve orientation and mobility skills in people who are visually impaired”. The authors are Juliana Damasio, Márcia Campos, Alexandre Amory, and Rafael Bordini. Márcia Campos works at Inedi College, while the other authors are from PUC-RS, both in Brazil.
Many robot programming environments are inaccessible for students who are visually impaired because are based on graphical interfaces and do not respect accessibility criteria. Thus, we have developed the GoDonnie that is a Logo-based language used to simulate a robot's behavior in a virtual environment. This simulation is described to the user through audible messages. GoDonnie has commands for the robot to move (FW and BW) and rotate (TR and TL), and specific commands for end-users to explore the virtual environment such as SCAN, COLOR, POSITION, and STATE. Also, has the selection, repeat, procedure, and assignment commands that are common to general-purpose programming languages. 
We evaluated GoDonnie with two users who are visually impaired. They performed a set of programming activities with GoDonnie and a tactile map produced in EVA material. Both participants correctly reproduced the virtual environment on the tactile map with the help of GoDonnie. The experiments demonstrate that GoDonnie helps users to understand the space and relationship between objects.
