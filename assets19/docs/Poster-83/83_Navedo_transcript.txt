Title: Strength-Based ICT Design Supporting Individuals with Autism. 

Authors: Jessica Navedo, Amelia Espiritu-Santo, and Dr. Shameem Ahmed from Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA, USA.

While sociocommunicative behaviors of the autistic population are frequently pathologized, the researchers find evidence via an exploratory thematic analysis of 21 essays supporting strength-based approaches which utilize the natural talents, strengths, interests and communication styles of individuals with autism, resulting in higher degrees of wellbeing.
A strength-based perspective assumes that communities and individuals are resilient, creative, and possess a deep self-knowing which informs solutions, emphasizing the necessity of incorporation of and collaboration with the autistic community these technologies seek to support.

ICT designs supporting strengths common among individuals with autism use simple interfaces, user-focused complexity in functionality, sensory-based design supporting enhanced sensory processing, and highlight customization and personalization as well as predictability and consistency to provide fluid structure.
