Image 1: The Dynamic Sensor Orientation Unit mounted on the Intelligent Mobility Cane (IMC) which consists of an ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, microcontrollers and 9-Degrees of Freedom (9DOF) sensor. The microcontroller reads the angle of the cane from the 9DOF sensor and determines the adjusted angle for the ultrasonic sensor. The microcontroller instructs the servo motor to rotate the ultrasonic sensor to the adjusted angle. 

Image 2: The Intelligent Mobility Cane with an ultrasonic sensor mounted 12 inches from the tip of the cane. The initial angle calculated from the 9DOF sensor and the adjusted angle determined by the microcontroller are displayed. The adjusted angle ensures a 36-inch detection distance from the tip of the cane is maintained.

Graph 1: Shows the variation in the cane angle for each participant that was recorded while the participants were navigating the obstacle path.
 
Table 1: Shows the mean cane angle recorded in degrees for each participant. The mean is the sum of all cane angles recorded for 1 participant divided by the total number of cane angles recorded for the same participant. The standard deviation in degrees for each participant is the minimum and maximum variations from the mean. Each participantâ€™s height and grasping technique is also mentioned.
