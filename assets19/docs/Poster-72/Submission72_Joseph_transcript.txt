There have been many recent developments in navigational aids for people with disabilities that complement GPS-based applications. These include applications such as BlindSquare and SoundScape. Moreover, there have been systems developed utilizing a combination of Bluetooth-Low Energy beacons, Wi-Fi and or Computer Vision such as NavCog, GuideBeacon, ASSIST, and PerCept. These auxiliary location-based services promise to provide wayfinding capabilities in GPS-limited areas.

While most of the initial research expectedly has been on creating prototypes and their evaluations, it is not clear how these can be sustainably deployed on a large-scale because we do not know what two key stakeholders in the process think about them and their future. These stakeholders are city planners who will likely deploy and manage such systems in communities, and non-profit agency personnel who serve people with disabilities that typically advocate for such aids for their constituents. 

This work presents the results from a survey of 45 city planners and 30 non-profit agency personnel from the city of Wichita and surrounding towns  on their thoughts about auxiliary location-based services. 

The key conclusions from this study are the following: 

City planners and non-profit personnel expressed a need for adequately funding auxiliary location-based services with a recommendation for funding through private-public partnerships. 

Auxiliary location-based services were identified to be desirable for safety (emergency and evacuation) needs along with navigational needs of people with disabilities, who are currently helped by family and friends.

City planners and non-profit personnel differ in their perception of potential impacts of such location-based services and there is a need for education of all stakeholders.
