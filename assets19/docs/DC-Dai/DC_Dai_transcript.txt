My overarching research goal is to explore technologies to empower people with dementia in social sharing.
To date, I have completed the fieldwork and investigated the challenges people with dementia encounter when sharing stories and socializing in a small group, as well as effective materials and prompts in supporting their storytelling.

My fieldwork is situated at Tales & Travels, a storytelling and social program in a local public library.
It invites people with dementia to explore a country every week.
Each session consists of a 1-hour story time, a 20-minute coffee break with featured snacks, and a 20-minute video time.
I conducted dyad interviews with people with dementia and their family caregivers, as well as individual interviews with caregivers and facilitators. 
I also observed the sessions and took field notes.
I performed thematic analysis on interview transcripts and observation notes.

The fieldwork findings show that people with dementia are able to enjoy social sharing and contribute to the story telling and discussions.
But a successful social sharing program requires proper framing and careful crafting.
I have identified the following best practices:
Exploring community settings,
Encouraging peer collaboration,
Choosing mature and intellectual materials and activities,
Furthering tangible interactions and multisensory experiences,
Adopting technologies carefully,
Facilitating properly and professionally.

My next steps are the design and evaluation of a new social sharing tool for people with dementia.
