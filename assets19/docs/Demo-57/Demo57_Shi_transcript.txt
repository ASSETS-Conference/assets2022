Title: A Demonstration of Molder: An Accessible Design Tool for Tactile Maps
Authors: Lei Shi, Yuhang Zhao, Elizabeth Kupferstein, Shiri Azenkot from Cornell University and Cornell Tech.
Printed tactile materials like tactile maps are important learning materials for people with visual impairments. Designing tactile materials relies on highly complex and visual-reliant modeling software. Since 3D modeling software relies on visual cues and can be difficult to learn, designing tactile materials is often inaccessible to inexperienced users and more so to people with visual impairments. Molder presents a design paradigm, which can be used both by those who are inexperienced and people with visual impairments.
This poster has seven figures describing the Molder software. Four of the figures show the process of how to use Molder to design a tactile map. First, a user needs to generate a digital draft model from a website, which is accessible to screen readers. Then, he must print the draft model and accessories. To modify the draft model, he uses his finger to touch different parts of the model. The Molder application senses his gesture and performs modifications accordingly. Finally, he prints the modified model. The final three figures on the poster show some sample functions of Molder. For example, a user can add different tactile patterns, braille labels, and interactive labels on a draft model. In addition, using Molder the user can also resize the model.
