In this poster, we are trying to answer whether people with different invisible disabilities would encounter discrimination when working on different sharing economy platforms. We used a mixed-method to answer the research question. We designed a three-times-two factorial between-group experiment to measure the effect of disability types (including physical, psychiatric, and no disabilities) and sharing economy platforms (including offline and online work) on perceptions of service providers’ credibility and employability suitability. We distributed surveys on Amazon Mechanic Turk in February 2019 and received 97 valid responses. In the statistical analysis, we didn’t find a significant effect of disability status and types of sharing economy work on Credibility and Employment Suitability. We used an affinity diagram to categorize primary themes generating from the open-end responses for employability suitability, including questions of clients’ additional information before making hiring decision and reasons for their decisions of selecting the specific service providers. We summarized three essential main themes from participants responses, namely Work-Related Attributes, Platform, and Personal traits.
