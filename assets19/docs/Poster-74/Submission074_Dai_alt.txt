In the first figure, it displayed one sample of experimental materials we used in the experiment. It is mocked up from the profile images from Rover. On the left side of the figure, it displayed a female’s photo with her dog. Under the profile, it shows what kind of dog she can take care of, from small (0-15 lbs) to large (101+). On the right side, it displays the basic information about the sitter: her name is Annie, she lives in Indianapolis, she has a response rate at 100%, response time is under half an hour. The main part of the picture is Annie’s self-introduction: I have been dog sitting on Rover since 2016 and have been caring for my own dogs for 20 years. I have experience with house sitting, dog boarding, drop-in visits, and walking. I’ve sat puppies, giant dogs, and everything in between. I also have experience in in giving medicine. I look forward to meeting you and you’re puppies! I started working from home last year after I was diagnosed with traumatic brain injury. This condition does not impact the quality of my work, though it may take me more time to respond to your messages (up to 24 hours). Get free consultations!
