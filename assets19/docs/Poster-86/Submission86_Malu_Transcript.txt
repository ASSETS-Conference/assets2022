This poster is titled "Motor accessibility of smartwatch touch and bezel input". The authors are Meethu Malu (now at Google), Pramod Chundury from the University of Maryland, and Leah Findlater from the University of Washington.The research question was: Can input on the smartwatch bezel provide accessible control compared to the touchscreen for people with upper body motor impairments? We had two hypotheses: first, that bezel input is faster than touchscreen input, and second, that bezel input is more accurate than touchscreen input. These hypotheses are based on past work that shows that hard edges can be useful for helping to stabilize touch input by people with upper body motor disabilities.We created two custom smartwatch apps, one for the touchscreen and one that took input from conductive fabric affixed to the smartwatch bezel. For each trial, the apps displayed a yellow target and played an audio cue. A trial was successfully completed if the user tapped the given target, or timed out as an error after 10 seconds. The study used a 2x2 within subjects design that included two factors: interaction technique, which was the bezel or touchscreen, and layout, which meant four larger targets or 8 smaller targets. We recruited 14 participants with upper body motor impairments, who completed 48 test trials in each of the four conditions.In terms of input performance, findings revealed a speed-accuracy tradeoff. Counter to our first hypothesis, the bezel input was significantly slower than the touchscreen input. But we found support for our second hypothesis, in that the bezel input was more accurate than the touchscreen input.For overall preference, the touchscreen was preferred. However, the bezel was preferred for specific tasks like when needing to limit visual occlusion or for shortcut gestures.
