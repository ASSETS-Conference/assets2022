Gauging Interest in Digital Personalized Simulations of Hearing Loss For Parents of DHH Children

Digital personalized simulations of hearing loss might improve understanding for hearing parents of d/Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) children, but only if there is demand for it. We surveyed six hearing parents of DHH children online to assess factors that might influence this demand, as well as the base demand itself. 

A DHH diagnosis can change parents’ expectations for how their child will develop throughout life — questions arise about what it means to have a DHH child, and for some parents, this questioning can lead to despair. We found that three parents (B,D,E) do not hope for ‘restored hearing’, while two parents (A, F) still strongly cling to it.

We then explored the level of understanding that parents have about their DHH children, in terms of adaptation, selection of schools, language learning, and Deaf community inclusion. We found that three parents (B,D,E) have a high level of understanding of their children's DHH experiences. 

Perhaps the combination of parents with high hope in restored hearing (A,F) and parents with a high level of understanding (B,D,E) would mean that few were interested in hearing loss simulations. However, we found that 4 out of 6 parents (A,B,C,D) expressed interest, including one with high hope (A) and two with high understanding (B, D). Based on this, we plan to develop the technology moving forward.
