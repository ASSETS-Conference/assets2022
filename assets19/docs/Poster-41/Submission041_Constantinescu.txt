Towards a Standardized Grammar for Navigation Systems for Persons with Visual Impairments

We address the problem that pedestrian navigation systems are rarely accessible or suit the needs of persons with visual impairments. They usually lack a standardized grammar for their speech instructions, forcing users to learn new types of instructions for each new system.

Thus, our goal is to create a standardized, localized (German) grammar for a GPS-based navigation system for People with Visual Impairments that transmits all necessary information about e.g. turns, crossings and objects of interest in an appropriate manner. 
Our system consists of a smartphone app, a backpack with high-performance laptop, a ZED mini camera and bone conducting headphones. The system recognizes paths, obstacles, traffic lights, road crossings, interesting landmarks, buildings and objects. 

We evaluated our grammar within a qualitative user study with 15 participants with visual impairments who walked three city routes with our grammar implemented in a mobile navigation system with and without the CV system. The overall usefulness of the system was rated with 1.93 from 1 very useful to 5 very useless. Participants assessed positively the compact and concise grammar, few error sources and the clear and loud instructions. They also liked the customization option which is necessary because of distinct participantsâ€™ needs.
