Our research poster is called, "Insights for More Usable VR for People with Amblyopia". 
This poster is by Ocean Hurd, an undergradute computer engineering student and Sri Kurniawan, 
a professor of computational media, both from UC Santa Cruz.

We created a virtual reality (VR) video game and tested how comfortable it was for people with Amblyopia, a neurological eye disorder, to use.
Our research found some recurring themes from our user base of people with Amblyopia that suggests VR games should be created 
with some design features in mind to keep them usable, particularly when it comes using VR video game as therapy for Amblyopia, 
which has become so popular.
