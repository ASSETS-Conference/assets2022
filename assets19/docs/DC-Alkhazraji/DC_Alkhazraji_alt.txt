The image illustrates the annotation software for the motion-capture data. The top-left corner illustrates three views (front, side, and zoomed) for the ASL signer. The bottom section of the image shows different annotation tires used by linguistic to annotate the corpus.

Figure 2
Image of Blender animation software with skeleton character. This image illustrates the process of extracting the bones coordinates from animations files of our motion corpus to a textual format that can be used for modeling. 

Figure 3
An example of a script for a sign language sentence (labelled "a") with three phases of processing to insert pauses between some words (labelled "b"), to adjust the speed of individual words (labelled "c"), and to adjust the duration of the pauses (labelled "d").  The example transcript included in the image is: they make computer program it name #chess program play game chess use #SUPER computer.  For each step of the process, the image displays the same sentence, illustrated with the words as individual rectangles of different width and with some amount of space between them. The width of the rectangle indicates word length, and the space between them indicates if there is a pause during the timeline between those two words.

Figure 4
Graph displaying the accuracy values for Pause Insertion, comparing two items: Our model with 75% accuracy and the state-of-the-art rule-based approach with 63% accuracy.  My model has a higher value, which indicates a better result.

Figure 5
Graph displaying the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values for the two regression models: Differential Rate and Pause Insertion. For Differential Rate, my model is 0.64, and the state-of-the-art rule-based approach is 0.84.  For Pause Duration, my model is 5.31, and the rule-based approach is 6.23.  In both cases, my model has a lower value, which indicates a better result.
