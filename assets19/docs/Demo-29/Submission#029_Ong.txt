Our poster is titled Expanding Blocks4All with Functions and Variables, and is co-authored by undergraduate student researchers Jacqueline Shao Yi Ong, Nana Adwoa O. Amoah, Alison E. Garrett-Engele, Mariella Irene Page, and Katherine R. McCarthy, and their faculty supervisor Lauren Milne. All authors are affiliated with Macalester College. In our poster, we discuss the changes we have made to Blocks4All, a blocks-based programming environment originally created by Milne for the Apple iPad. It is designed for children with visual impairments, who can use it to build programs that control the Wonder Workshop robots Dash and Dot. The changes made to Blocks4All include improving the accessibility of the user interface, allowing users to modify robot actions and to create functions that can be called in their program, and adding more robot commands. In the future, we hope to thoroughly evaluate Blocks4All’s visual and motor accessibility with the aid of experts, and to continue expanding upon the application. In this poster, we included six figures. The first four figures compare the appearance of Blocks4All’s main menu and main workspace before and after our changes to the application, and the last two demonstrate how users can create and add variables to their program by tapping on the block that represents a variable, setting its value on a separate screen, and then in the main workspace, tapping again to place it in their program.
