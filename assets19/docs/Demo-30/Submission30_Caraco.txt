Block-based programming environments are generally inaccesible for children with visual impairments. We designed two touchscreen interfaces for use with a screen reader for the Blockly library. The first interface is our spatial design. In this design, descriptions of block regions are read aloud by the screen reader when the user selects blocks. The second interface is our hierarchical list design. Here, a navigable list which mirrors the workspace is placed on the side of the screen. This allows the user to fully interact with Blockly-based environments purely using this list. We are still working on improving these designs and getting them tested.
