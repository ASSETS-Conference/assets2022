Development of a real time Bionic Voice system for people without a larynx

People who lose their larynx due to cancer, lose their ability to generate a natural voice for ever. In this specific problem "voice" is different with speech.
Voice is the sound that human vocal folds generate. We can then shape this sound into speech by moving our face and lips muscles.
People who lose their larynx can still move their face and lips muscles. But they don't have a voice source that sounds like natural human voice anymore.

We have introduced Bionic Voice, the first and only wearable electronic voice prosthesis that generates a high quality voice for these people using respiration. Inside the device, there an Artificial Intelligence or AI algorithm that can be trained to generate a voice similar to the natural vocal folds sound. We have developed and trained this algorithm in our offline Bionic voice method before.

In this paper, we implement the AI algorithm online or in real-time and we demonstrate its performance compared to the offline system. You are welcome to listen to audio samples of this real-time Bionic Voice.
