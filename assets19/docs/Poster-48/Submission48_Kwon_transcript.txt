People with visual impairments are interested in artworks as much as their sighted peers. However, their experience is limited because most artworks are visual.

To enable people with visual impairments to explore and understand artworks independently, we propose a touchscreen-based mobile application which provides object-level verbal descriptions of a painting upon users' touch. For example, if a user touches a certain object in a painting displayed on a touchscreen the app provides the label, color and the location of the object such as "A cypress tree, painted black, located on the left side of the painting".

We conducted a semi-structured interview study using our application with 8 participants with visual impairments where they were asked to explore 4 different paintings and then provide their description and opinion about each painting.

We found that our application enables them to understand the shape and location of several objects of the painting, and to gain knowledge of the painting as if reading encyclopedia.
Also, they valued that they could access paintings at any time they want at their own pace without sighted person's help, and save time and money because they do not need to visit a museum.

In conclusion, our application can help people with visual impairments to freely explore and learn various paintings more in detail with object-level descriptions as well as spatial information such as position and size.
