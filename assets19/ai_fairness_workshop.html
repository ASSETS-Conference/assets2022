        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in decision-making that directly impacts people’s lives. Much has been written about the potential for AI methods to encode, perpetuate, and even amplify discrimination against marginalized groups in society. Like age, gender, and race, disability status is a protected characteristic, but there are some crucial differences between disability groups and other protected groups. One difference is the extreme diversity of ways disabilities manifest, and people adapt. Secondly, disability information is highly sensitive and not always shared, precisely because of the potential for discrimination; AI systems may often not have explicit information about disability that can be used to apply established fairness tests and corrections. Thirdly, some disabilities have relatively low rates of occurrence, so that  individuals can appear as data outliers rather than part of a recognizable subgroup. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This workshop will examine AI fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE) for the specific situations of people with disabilities. We invite researchers, disability advocates, policy makers, and practitioners to submit position papers on topics including (but not limited to):
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Definitions of fairness and how they apply in the disability space
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data privacy and control
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fairness policies
                </li>
                <li>
                    Measuring fairness for disability groups
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data collection
                </li>
                <li>
                    AI methods that support fairness, transparency, and explainability for disability use cases
                </li>
                <li>
                    Methods of handling outlier individuals
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ways of approaching fairness for disability groups in AI-based systems
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bias and discrimination case studies and experience reports
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The purpose of this workshop is to develop community across disciplines in the area of AI FATE as it regards people with disabilities, towards developing new research directions and collaborations, and strategic action plans for increasing impact in research, industry, and policy. Immediate outcomes will be discussed in the workshop, and may include organizing a submission to, or special issue of, the ACM SIGACCESS Newsletter, or similar venue.
