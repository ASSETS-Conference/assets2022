          <h2><a name="q1">How do I communicate accessibility needs to ASSETS 2019 organizers?</a></h2>

          <p>The Accessibility Chairs for ASSETS 2019 is Dhruv Jain and Raja Kushalnagar, whose goal is to ensure the conference is accessible to everyone. When you register for the conference, there will be a registration question labeled "Do you have a disability or special need which requires our awareness?". In your response, please indicate any accessibility needs such as wheelchair access, sign language interpretation, or a guide. The Accessibility Chairs will follow up with you to clarify your needs. You can contact them directly at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:access-assets19@acm.org">access-assets19@acm.org</a>.</p>

          <h2><a name="q2">Who do I ask if my question is not answered here?</a></h2>

          <p>More information about accessibility at The Omni William Penn Hotel is available on their <a href="https://www.omnihotels.com/accessibility">accessibility information page</a>.</p>
          <p>Please contact The Omni William Penn Hotel on <a href="tel:+1 (412) 281-7100">+1 (412) 281-7100</a> or email <a href="mailto:reservations@omnihotels.com">reservations@omnihotels.com</a> to discuss your specific needs with the venue directly.</p>

          <p>If there is specific accessibility information you would like to see here, or if you wish to discuss any conference accessibility requirements, please contact our Accessibility Chairs, Dhruv Jain and Raja Kushalnagar by email: <a href="mailto:access-assets19@acm.org">access-assets19@acm.org</a>, and someone will respond to you shortly.</p>

          <h2><a name="q3">Will sign language interpretation or captioning be available?</a></h2>

          <p>The conference will provide a team of sign language interpreters or captioners if requested by any attendees during the early registration period. Please make your request as early as possible. Our Accessibility Chairs will follow up with you to discuss your needs in more detail. After late August (the deadline for early registration), a best effort will be made to accommodate requests, but we cannot guarantee that interpreters or captioners will be available.</p>

          <h2><a name="q4">What are the taxi and public transport options for getting to the conference venue?</a></h2>

          <p>See the <a href="travel.html" target="_blank">Travel</a> and <a href="getting_around.html" target="_blank">Getting Around</a> pages for transportation services in Pittsburgh.</p>

          <h2><a name="q5">Who can I ask about accessibility in Pittsburgh, PA, USA?</a></h2>

          <p>Attendees who require personal care assistance should bring their own assistant. Personal care assistants do not need to register for the conference. If the assistant will be having food and drink provided by the conference during coffee/tea breaks, lunches, and/or the reception, we ask that these be added into the attendee's registration at the 'extra options' stage of the registration process.</p>

          <h2><a name="q7">What is the conference space like?</a></h2>

          <!--
              COMMENT: This section should provide a map of the conference space that shows the following information:
              - the location of stairs, escalators, elevators, restrooms and wheelchair-accessible restrooms.
              - walking distance between sessions and need to use stairs.
              - places to sit and rest.
              - whether there will be a quiet place where hard of hearing people can talk.
              - whether there will be a private room where an attendee could rest or nurse a baby.
              - where a guide dog can be taken to relieve itself.

              COMMENT: For the benefit of those who cannot see the map, a textual description should also be included.
              Here's an example of what this description might look like for a small event in a hotel:
          -->

          <p>For the overall layout of the venue, please refer to this <a href="images/ASSETS2019_Conference_Space_floor17.pdf">map of the conference space</a>.</p>

          <p>The conference will be held on the 17th floor , which will be reserved for ASSETS. The main presentation sessions will be held in the Grand Ballroom, and the coffee breaks/poster sessions will be in the adjoining Urban Room. Lunch will be down the hall in the Monongahela Room. Both of the elevator banks travel to the 17th floor. Restrooms (which are wheelchair-accessible) are near the Monongahela Room. The registration desks will be between the elevator banks, in the hall leading to the Monongahela Room. The halls on this floor will have a few chairs and benches, and those that are further away from the Grand Ballroom should be less loud. The Bedford room is reserved for quiet space. The distance from the registration desk to the Grand Ballroom is approximately 50 ft.</p>

          <p>We are still working on an evacuation plan for attendees with mobility limitations.</p>

          <p>Please see our other FAQs for more details about <a href="#q8">wheelchair or power scooter access</a>, <a href="#q10">provisions for presenters</a>, <a href="#q9">restrooms</a>, <a href="#q13">walking and steps</a>, and <a href="#q11">facilities for assistance animals</a>.</p>

          <h2><a name="q8">Will the conference be accessible by wheelchair or power scooter?</a></h2>

          <!--
              COMMENT: This section should provide information for wheelchair and power scooter users, including:
              - wheelchair access routes into the conference venue.
              - wheelchair route from the entrance or lobby to the meeting rooms and/or guest accommodation.
              - if venue is a hotel - wheelchair route from the hotel rooms to the meeting space.
              - location of wheelchair-accessible restrooms.
              - warnings about any steps or stairs between conference locations.
              - where to get more detailed information about accessibility at the venue.
              - if there will be a raised stage, will there be a ramp onto it?
              - wheelchair access and transportation for any offsite events.
          -->

          <p>
              Yes, the conference will be accessible to wheelchair users. The hotel has several entrances from the street, but only one is wheelchair accessible. The Oliver Ave entrance has a ramp and is the closest to the registration desk. The doorman at the William Penn Ave. entrance should be able to direct you around the corner to reach it. The reception desk has a side section that is lower for wheelchair users, and the route to the elevators is level. The restaurants and coffee shop off of the main lobby are accessible via narrow ramps. The elevators lead to the guest and meeting rooms. Three wheelchair-accessible guest rooms are available. The Grand Ballroom will have wheelchair spaces by the central aisle at the back of the room. Student volunteers will be available on request to help with the lunch buffet, and there will be space for wheelchairs at the lunch tables. 
          </p>

          <p>There will be a ramp onto the stage for presenters. Wireless microphones will be available.</p>

          <p>We are still working on an evacuation plan for attendees with mobility limitations.</p>

          <p>We are still gathering information on wheelchair access to the offsite events. Please contact us directly with any questions.</p>

          <h2><a name="q9">What are the restroom facilities like?</a></h2>

          <p>We are still working on a description of the restrooms.</p>

          <h2><a name="q10">What are the arrangements for presenters with accessibility needs?</a></h2>

          <p>Session presentations will take place in the grand ballroom. There will be a raised stage with ramp access. The stage is 16 inches high and the approximate depth of 8 feet. Poster sessions will take place in the Urban room.

        Presenters who need any accommodations should contact the Accessibility Chairs: Dhruv Jain and Raja Kushalnagar at access-assets19@acm.org.
        </p>

          <p>There will be a ramp onto the stage for presenters. Wireless microphones will be available.</p>

          <p>If you would like a student volunteer to operate slides or guide you onto and off the stage, or have other accessibility requests please contact Dhruv Jain and Raja Kushalnagar at <a href="mailto:access-assets19@acm.org">access-assets19@acm.org</a> by late August.</p>

          <h2><a name="q11">Can I bring my guide dog?</a></h2>

          <p>Yes! Guide dogs and other service animals are welcome at ASSETS 2019. Please indicate on your registration form if you anticipate bringing a service animal to the conference.</p>

          <p>At the Pittsburgh airport, there is a <a href="https://www.flypittsburgh.com/programs-services/services/pet-relief-area" target="_blank">pet relief area</a>.</p>

          <p>Directly across the street from the hotel, there is a pet-friendly park called Mellon Square Park (on top of the Garage with the same name). There are some grassy areas inside the park. Walk out of the hotel’s main entrance located on William Penn Place. Take a right to get to the intersection with Sixth Avenue and cross William Penn Place by taking a left. Once you cross, you’ll have to double back a bit and take a right into the park entrance. As you enter, there are some mulched areas inside the retaining wall lip at the right. There are other grassy areas within retaining walls throughout the park.

          <h2><a name="q12">Can I attend the conference by robot?</a></h2>


          <p>We are sorry, but ASSETS 2019 will not be able to accommodate remote attendance by robot.</p>

          <h2><a name="q13">How much walking or standing will be needed?</a></h2>

          <!--
              COMMENT: This section should describe:
              - how far it is from the conference space to the elevator,
              - how far to the nearest accessible bathroom, and
              - mention any ramp that is needed to move between parts of the space.
          -->

          <p>The conference will require minimal walking as all presentation sessions are in a single room with breaks and poster sessions next-door. Lunch is down the hall, approximately 100 feet. The conference rooms are approximately 50 feet from the elevator. A limited amount of seating will be available during break and poster sessions.</p>
          <p>On Tuesday evening the conference reception will take place at the Andy Warhol Museum on the North Side. The route is relatively walkable; about 15 minutes from the conference venue. There are also public transit options but require a similar amount of walking, just with a subway in between. Here's the walking map to the Andy Warhol Museum. For attendees who prefer to use uber or lyft, the ride is about 6 minutes for $8-10 USD.

          <h2><a name="q14">Will there be an induction loop in the meeting rooms?</a></h2>

          <p>
              The venue does not have an induction loop setup. If you need this, please talk to the Accessibility Chairs so that we may look for alternative accommodations.
               
          </p>

          <h2><a name="q15">Will speakers and audience members asking questions be using a microphone?</a></h2>

          <p>
              Yes, microphones will be used for all speakers.
              Attendees with questions will be requested to use a microphone so that their question is more easily heard.
          </p>

          <h2><a name="q16">What food service will be provided?</a></h2>

          <p>The conference will provide buffet lunches and refreshments at breaks. Dishes will be labeled. If you have special dietary needs, please indicate these clearly on your registration form.</p>

          <h2><a name="q17">Can the conference accommodate special dietary needs?</a></h2>

          <p>Yes. Attendees who indicate special dietary requirements on their registration form will be provided with special meals when the conference catering does not accommodate them. If you have a severe allergy please indicate this on your registration form.</p>

          <h2><a name="q18">Will the conference be a smoke-free environment?</a></h2>

          <p>

            We are still gathering information on where there are smoking areas around the venue.
          </p>

          <h2><a name="q20">Will there be loud music, strobe lighting, spotlights, or other strong sensory experiences?</a></h2>

          <p>We are still gathering information on sensory aspects of the conference. Participants will be requested not to use flash photography or to wear strong scents. Please indicate on your registration form if there are specific items you would like to know about in advance.</p>

          <p>We are still gathering information on sensory demands of the offsite events and availability of quiet places.</p>

          <p>Please contact Dhruv Jain and Raja Kushalnagar at <a href="mailto:access-assets19@acm.org">access-assets19@acm.org</a> as early as possible if you have further questions or special requests.</p>


          <h2><a name="q21">Will there be a designated quiet space at the conference?</a></h2>

          <p>The Bedford room on the 17th floor will be set up and available for use as quiet space.</p>

          <h2><a name="q19">What if I have a medical emergency or health problem during the conference?</a></h2>

            <p>In case of emergency call <a href="tel:911">911</a> for an ambulance. The nearest hotel UPMC Mercy is 0.8 miles away. If you require non-urgent medical care, please contact Dhruv Jain and Raja Kushalnagar at <a href="mailto:access-assets19@acm.org">access-assets19@acm.org</a> or ask any student volunteer. They will provide you with information about local doctors, specialists, chiropractors, etc. For non-resident attendees, buying travel insurance that covers medical expenses is strongly recommended as fees for emergency treatment can be very high.</p>
