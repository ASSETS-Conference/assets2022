        <h1>Getting around Pittsburgh</h1>

        <h2>On foot:</h2>

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/pittsburgh-william-penn" target="_blank">The Omni William Penn Hotel</a> is located in Downtown Pittsburgh, which is fairly walkable. From there, you can also visit the North Side and Strip District neighborhoods in 15-20 minute walk. For further neighborhoods, such as Oakland, South Side, or Lawrenceville, consider taking a taxi or public transit.
        </p>

        <h2>Public transit:</h2>

        <p>
          The public transit is operated by the <a href="https://www.portauthority.org/" target="_blank">Port Authority of Allegheny</a> county, and consists of some light rail, many buses, and two of our famous <a href="https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/duquesne-incline/" target="_blank">inclines</a>. You can ride the light rail (called the “T”) for free in the Downtown zone, including over to the North Shore (location of sports stadiums, etc).
        </p>

        <p>
          The buses will take you around the rest of the city. The best smartphone app for planning trips is <a href="https://transitapp.com/" target="_blank">Transit</a>, although you can also use <a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> or the <a href="https://www.portauthority.org/trip-planner/" target="_blank">Port Authority trip planner</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For fare information, including how to get a reloadable ConnectCard, <a href="https://www.portauthority.org/fares-and-passes/" target="_blank">see the Port Authority website</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>By car:</h2>

        <p>
          You can take taxis (<a href="https://www.ztrip.com/" target="_blank">zTrip</a>) or <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank">Uber</a>/<a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="_blank">Lyft</a> around the city pretty easily. If you take an Uber, there’s a small chance you may end up in a self-driving vehicle, which engineers test in some city neighborhoods.
        </p>

        <p>
          Driving in Pittsburgh can be a little maddening, because there isn’t an easy grid system and some streets are annoyingly narrow. You should also be aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_left" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Left</a>, which is a local custom regarding left turns that may confuse people form out of town.
