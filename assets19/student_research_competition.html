            How the Student Research Competition Will Work
        </h2>

        <p>
            The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) is an event open to undergraduate and graduate students. At the conference, the authors will present their poster to a panel of experts and those who qualify to the next round will present their research to the conference audience. All accepted SRC submissions will be published in the conference proceedings and the best presentations will receive a prize. The SRC is a fantastic opportunity to be introduced to the community and establish networks with fellow scientists.
        </p>

            Eligibility    
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Participants must be currently enrolled (at the time of submission) in a university or college and have an active ACM student membership. If you are not a member yet, you can <a href="https://campus.acm.org/public/qj/quickjoin/qj_control.cfm?form_type=Student" target="_blank">join the ACM</a> by paying a US$19 fee per year.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>At the graduate level (MS or PhD students), only individual research is accepted.</b> Group research projects <u>will not</u> be considered, meaning graduate submissions cannot include advisor names.If an individual is part of a group research project and wants to participate in an SRC, they can only present their part of the research (their contribution to the project). Only the individual author will receive the travel stipend and monetary award (should they win).
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>At the undergraduate level, team projects are acceptable.</b> One team member should be designated to attend the conference and make the oral presentation. This person along with another team member will be eligible for travel reimbursement for up to $500.00. The award goes to the individual presenting at the SRC (should they win). Students may only participate in one ACM SRC per program year (July 1-June 30). Students that have applied to an SRC, but have not been accepted, may respond to other SRC calls for participation during the program year.

            </li>

            <li>
                Work accepted as a full paper for one of the technical sessions of the conference cannot also be considered for the Student Research Competition. Students having a technical paper, however, are encouraged to submit separate work to the Student Research Competition.
            </li>

            <li>
                The same topic of work cannot be presented at more than one of the conference venues (SRC, DC, or as a regular technical paper).
            </li>

            <li>
                SRC submissions should not be under review at other conference or similar venues.  
            </li>

            Participating in the SRC
        </h2>

            Once SRC submissions are reviewed, accepted projects will be invited to present at ASSETS 2019. At the conference, there will be two rounds of competition:
        </p>

        <h3 tabindex="0">
            First Round Competition
        </h3>

        <p>
            Participants will display a poster and make a brief presentation to a panel of judges. After the judges have reviewed the posters and discussed the research with each participant, a group of semi-finalists for each category (undergraduate and graduate) will be selected to present at the second round of the competition.
        </p>

        <h3 tabindex="0">
            Second Round Competition
        </h3>

        <p>
            Semi-finalists will then give an oral presentation on their work as part of a main conference session. A panel of judges will evaluate their knowledge of the research area, their contribution to the field, and the quality of the presentation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Three winners will be chosen in each category, undergraduate and graduate, receiving their medals (gold, silver, and bronze) and a monetary prize of $500, $300, and $200, respectively. First place winners will be designated as finalists and will also advance to the SRC Grand Finals. <i>Participants should plan to stay through the ASSETS conference as the awards ceremony will take place during the closing session.</i>

        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Upon request, American Sign Language interpreters will be provided for participants in the SRC, both during the competition itself and for the remainder of the ASSETS conference. Requests for an interpreter must be indicated on the conference registration form when registering for ASSETS.

            Advancing to the SRC Grand Finals
        </h2>    

        <p>
            First place undergraduate and graduate student winners from the ACM SRCs held throughout the year advance to the SRC Grand Finals. A panel of judges will evaluate the entries through an online competition. From this competition, three undergraduate and three graduate students from all ACM conferences will be designated the SRC Grand Finals winners. They are invited, along with their advisors, to the annual ACM Awards Banquet, where they receive formal recognition.
