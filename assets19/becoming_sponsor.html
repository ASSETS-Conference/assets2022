        <p>
            The ASSETS 2019 conference committee welcomes organizations and companies interested in reaching our prominent accessibility researchers, practitioners, developers, and policy-makers. Your contribution would help support travel scholarships targeted at students with disabilities, a doctoral consortium for aspiring PhD researchers, and accessibility support such as sign language interpreters. In exchange your brand and representatives will be among current and future leaders shaping the outlook of accessible and universal technology. Benefits and options for sponsorship are shown below. For more information or to sign-up, please contact the general chair, Jeffrey P. Bigham, at <a href="mailto:gc-assets19@acm.org">gc-assets19@acm.org</a>.
