                    <p>We invite you to submit a proposal for workshops at ASSETS 2022. Workshops will bring together attendees with shared interests to meet in the context of a focused and interactive discussion. ASSETS workshops should include topics relevant to the ASSETS community, including design, systems, tools, scientific understanding, methodology, or social issues relevant to and including people with disabilities or older adults. It may also focus on enabling technologies, technology use by people with disabilities, disability justice, legal and policy issues, or accessibility in computing education. Each workshop should generate ideas that will suggest promising directions for future work for the ASSETS community. If you are working in an emerging area in accessibility, please consider organizing a workshop.</p>

                    <p>To help reduce videoconferencing exhaustion and to broaden participation, we encourage organizers to think creatively and inclusively to make the workshops interactive. Workshop organizers may consider supporting offline activities ahead of / during the workshop (such as sending design kits to participants). Organizers may also want to consider tasks and activity design where attendees might be co-located (<i>e.g.,</i> a workshop that connects multiple research groups) and could physically work together prior to joining the online workshop event.</p>

                    <p>While traditionally at in-person workshops we would often work for upto 8 hours at a time, in online workshops we recommend that you reduce the length of time that your participants will be on the video call and opt for shorter, more interactive activities.</p>

                    <p>We expect to have participants from all around the world, as such it is vital that you plan your workshop to accommodate participants joining from a number of timezones. You might consider more break out asynchronous activities that participants can do on their own, complemented with shorter synchronous interactions where participants get together and discuss.</p>

                    <p>We would like the ASSETS community to guide and shape the workshops that will be included in the conference. As such, ASSETS Workshop track will follow an open review and then a Juried review process.</p>
                    <p>During the period between submissions and notifications researchers and practitioners who work in the areas of accessibility, disability and computing will be invited to comment and discuss the workshop proposal submissions within a reviewer forum via PCS in a non-anonymous format <sup style="color: #e84949;">*</sup>. Authors will also be encouraged to invite relevant members (such as potential attendees) to review the proposal and provide feedback.  Such discussion and feedback we hope will give the authors an opportunity to refine and adapt their workshop plans (if they choose) to ultimately create a successful workshop.</p>

                    <p>After the discussion period, the final selection will be curated by the workshops chairs based on the following assessment criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does the workshop foster community-building and look to broaden diversity in the ASSETS community?</li>
                        <li>Alignment of the workshop topic with the interests of the ASSETS community.</li>
                        <li>Workshops potential to generate discussion on new directions of future work by the ASSETS community.</li>
                        <li>Level of engagement and proposed interactivity in the workshop. For workshop proposals of comparable quality, preference will be given to workshops containing discussion, interactive sessions and a diverse organization team. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="color: #e84949;">* all reviewers will be required to consent to a review agreement prior to participating in the selection process. </p>

                    <p>Workshop organizers upon receiving notification of acceptance, must prepare to fulfill the following responsibilities prior to the workshop day:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Set up a website:</b> Organizers of an accepted workshop must set up and maintain a website with information about their workshop (deadlines, CfP, programme, templates, accepted papers/participants, organizers,<i>etc.</i>). We will include the link to the workshop’s page on the official ASSETS workshop site.</li>
                        <li><b>Advertise your workshop:</b> Share your call for participants within your professional network. Accepted workshops will also be listed on the ASSETS’22 web page.</li>
                        <li><b>Collect position papers or workshop artifacts:</b> From potential participants (depending on how the organizers run the workshop). A position paper can be a 2-4 pages document. An artifact can be a video or images of physical objects that outlines the submitter’s view on the workshop theme and the reasons for the submitter’s interest in the topic.</li>
                        <li><b>Set up a review process:</b> Select participants accordingly. We expect workshops to target a minimum number of 10 participants.</li>
                        <li><b>Plan for pre-workshop activities:</b> If applicable, share and distribute any pre-workshop materials (<i>e.g.,</i> design kits) to participants in advance of the workshop.</li>
                        <li><b>Distribute:</b> Share accepted position papers or workshop artifacts.  This will help participants to familiarize themselves with workshop content and encourage more in-depth discussions.</li>
                        <li>Ensure the workshop organizers and participants are aware of <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics" target="_blank">the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</li>
