                            <p>Harassment can occur when there is no deliberate intention to offend. Be
                                careful in the words that you choose. Harassment committed in a joking
                                manner or disguised as a compliment still constitutes unacceptable
                                behavior. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can
                                be offensive to those around you.</p>

                                participants in ACM activities. Any individual who feels his/her safety
                                is at risk due to harassment or for any other reason is encouraged to
                                take appropriate steps to ensure personal safety.</p>

                                person who is informed of harassment will be under an obligation to file
                                a report with an individual or organization outside of ACM.</p>

                            <p>In the event of unacceptable behavior, you may wish to inform a person in
                                authority. Those in authority to act in these cases include the event
                                chair, a SIG leader, an onsite ACM staff member, and other event
                                organizers who have been designated to handle such complaints at this
                                activity. These individuals can provide information about the process
                                for handling complaints or handling immediate onsite needs.</p>
                            <p><i>Note that there may be cases (such as those involving Title IX issues
                                    in the United States and venue- or employer-specific policies) where
                                    an on-site person who is informed of harassment will be required to
                                    file a complaint.</i></p>
                            <p>Any investigation or further action requires that a written communication
                                be made to ACM. Report the incident using the <a
                                    href="https://services.acm.org/harass/harass.cfm" target="_blank">form
                                    for Reporting Violations of the ACM Policy
                                    Against Harassment</a>. Prompt reporting is critical so that ACM can
                                take action to stop the conduct before it is repeated. All reports will
                                be followed up promptly, with further investigation conducted where
                                needed to confirm facts or resolve disputed facts. In conducting its
                                investigations, ACM will strive to keep the identity of the individual
                                making the report as confidential as possible beyond the investigation.
                            </p>
                            <p>ACM prohibits any threats or acts of retaliation against individuals who
                                report unacceptable behavior or provide information in connection with a
                                report by another individual. ACM considers a threat or act of
                                retaliation to be as serious an offense as harassment itself and will
                                handle reports of retaliation accordingly.</p>

                            <p>As a person in authority at an ACM event, you need to understand how to
                                handle possible incidents. Those in authority include the event chair, a
                                SIG leader, an onsite ACM staff member, and other event organizers who
                                have been designated to handle such complaints at this activity.</p>
                            <p>Your primary role as a person in authority is to (a) lend a sympathetic
                                ear and (b) explain procedures for reporting unacceptable behavior if a
                                person wishes to pursue further action. In general, you should not
                                attempt to mediate or resolve complaints informally.</p>
                            <p>If the situation appears to be an emergency (e.g., requiring medical
                                assistance or if there has been an overt threat of violence), you should
                                use judgment and common sense. Never presume, however, that an
                                individual would welcome your involvement. Instead, tell the person to
                                take any step he/she feels is needed to ensure personal safety.</p>
                            <p>If the immediate emergency extends to more than one individual, event
                                organizers may need to take stronger actions, such as addressing the
                                event attendees as a whole, barring further event attendance and
                                participation by specific attendees, or imposing requirements on an
                                attendeeâ€™s further participation. Such decisions should be kept as
                                minimally intrusive as possible, and must be made with the awareness
                                that an allegation is not the same as a determination of guilt. Any
                                post-event investigations, sanctions, or other actions should be handled
                                by using the <a href="https://services.acm.org/harass/harass.cfm"

                            <p>If an event uses contractors, the event organizers should make sure the
                                contractors are told to report any incident to a person in authority
                                rather than dealing with it themselves.</p>

                                or COO will review and direct appropriate follow up. In consultation
                                with the Chair of ACM's Committee on Professional Ethics (COPE), the
                                executive will also make a recommendation to COPE regarding resolution.
                                COPE will make a final, binding decision regarding whether ACM's policy
                                has been violated and the consequences of any such violation.</p>
                            <p>The Committee may take actions including, but not limited to, suspension
                                or termination of membership in ACM, exclusion from ACM leadership
                                positions, exclusion from participating in future ACM events, and/or
                                exclusion from deriving other benefits from ACM activities. Such actions
                                may be applied regardless of whether or not the offender is a member of
                                ACM.</p>
                            <p>The same actions may be taken toward any individual who engages in
                                retaliation or who knowingly makes a false allegation of harassment.</p>
