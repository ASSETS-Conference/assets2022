            How the Student Research Competition Will Work
        </h2>

        <p>
            The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) is an event open to undergraduate and graduate students. 
            At the conference, the authors will present their poster to a panel of experts and those who qualify 
            to the next round will present their research to the conference audience. All accepted SRC submissions 
            will be published in the conference proceedings and the best presentations will receive a prize. 
            The SRC is a fantastic opportunity to be introduced to the community and establish networks with fellow 
            scientists.
        </p>

            Testimonials
        </h2>

        <div class="quote">
            "The ACM SRC was a great opportunity to meet people from across the ASSETS community, as you are able to talk in small groups or one-on-one with many people about your research. I received a lot of great feedback about my project, and really honed the elevator pitch for my current research. Once I moved to the semi-finals, I quickly prepared a talk that was a lot of fun to give at the conference, partially because I had a great Halloween costume to go with it!"
            <div class="source">
                &mdash;Cole Gleason, Carnegie Mellon University, SRC graduate student participant in 2017.

        <div class="quote">
            “My trip to ASSETS 2017 was a rewarding experience. When presenting my project poster, ASSETS community members approached me with real interest in my work, and I made quite a few connections. After reaching the semi-finals of the SRC, I found the presentation to be a wonderful opportunity to share my research and practice my speech giving ability (this was my first conference presentation!). Overall, ASSETS was welcoming and enriching, and I recommend that all students with applicable projects submit work.”

            Eligibility    
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Participants must be currently enrolled (at the time of submission) in a university or college and have an active <b>ACM student membership</b> (see the <a href="https://www.acm.org/membership/membership-options" target="_blank">ACM's Membership Options page)</a>. If you are not a member yet, you can <a href="https://campus.acm.org/public/qj/quickjoin/qj_control.cfm?form_type=Student" target="_blank">join the ACM</a> by paying a US$ 19 fee per year.
            </li>

            <li>
                At the graduate level (MS or PhD students), only individual research is accepted; group research projects <u>will not</u> be considered. 
                However, if an individual is part of a group research project and wants to participate in an SRC, they can only present their part 
                of the research (their contribution to the project). Only they will receive the travel stipend and monetary award (should they win).
            </li>

            <li>
                At the undergraduate level, team projects are acceptable. One person should be designated by the team to attend the conference and make 
                the oral presentation. This person along with another team member will be eligible for travel reimbursement for up to $500.00. The award 
                goes to the individual presenting at the SRC (should they win). Students may only participate in one ACM SRC per program year (July 1-June 30). 
                Students that have applied to an SRC, but have not been accepted, may respond to other SRC calls for participation during the program year.
            </li>

            <li>
                Work accepted as a full paper for one of the technical sessions of the conference cannot also be considered for the Student Research Competition. Students having a technical paper, however, are encouraged to submit separate work to the Student Research Competition.
            </li>

            <li>
                The same topic of work cannot be presented in more than one of the conference categories (SRC, DC, or as a regular technical paper). However, participants may further submit their accepted work to other venues for publication as long as they: cite the SRC publication,  extend its contribution, and use a different title than the SRC submission.
            </li>

        <h3 tabindex="0">
            First Round Competition
        </h3>

        <p>
            Participants will display a poster and make a brief presentation to a panel of judges.

        </p>

        <h3 tabindex="0">
            Second Round Competition

        <p>
            Semi-finalists will then give an oral presentation on their work as part of a main conference session. A panel of judges will evaluate their knowledge of the research area, their contribution to the field, and the quality of the presentation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Three winners will be chosen in each category, undergraduate and graduate, receiving their medals (gold, silver, and bronze) and a monetary prize of $500, $300, and $200, respectively. First place winners will be designated as finalists and will also advance to the SRC Grand Finals.
