        <h2><a name="q1">How do I communicate accessibility needs to ASSETS 2018 organizers?</a></h2>

        <p>The Accessibility chairs for ASSETS 2018 are Kyle Montague and Raja Kushalnagar, whose goal is to ensure the conference is
        accessible to everyone. When you register for the conference, there will be a registration question
        labeled "Describe here any special accessibility or dietary needs." In your response, please indicate any accessibility needs
        such as wheelchair access, sign language interpretation, or a guide. The Accessibility chairs will follow
        up with you to clarify your needs. You can contact them directly at any time by emailing
        <a href="mailto:access-assets18@acm.org">access-assets18@acm.org</a>.</p>

        <h2><a name="q2">Who do I ask if my question is not answered here?</a></h2>

        <p>For more detailed information about accessibility at the Galmont Hotel & Spa, please

        any accessibility requirements, please contact our Accessibility chairs, Kyle Montague and Raja Kushalnagar by email:
        <a href="mailto:access-assets18@acm.org">access-assets18@acm.org</a>, and someone will respond to you shortly.</p>

        <h2><a name="q3">Will sign language interpretation or captioning be available?</a></h2>

        <p>The conference will provide a team of American sign language interpreters or captioners if requested by any attendees during the early registration period. Please make your request as early as possible. Our Accessibility chairs will follow up with you to discuss your needs in more detail. After the deadline for early registration, a best effort will be made to accommodate requests, but we cannot guarantee that interpreters or captioners will be available.</p>

            <a href="https://access.earth/" target="_blank">Access Earth</a> is a free platform that allows you to find and rate places by your accessibility needs.  Accessibility information about some places in Galway is available, and you also have the opportunity to contribute your own ratings.

        <h2><a name="q6">Can a student volunteer assist me during the conference?</a></h2>

        <p>Student volunteers will be available to assist attendees with disabilities with navigation, meal service,
        or other accessibility needs. If you will need volunteer assistance at the conference, please indicate this
        on your conference registration form.</p>

        <p>Attendees who require personal care assistance should bring their own assistant. If the assistant will be having food and drink provided by the conference during coffee/tea breaks, lunches, and/or the reception, we ask that these be added into the attendee's registration at the "extra options" stage of the registration process.</p>

        <h2><a name="q7">What is the conference space like?</a></h2>

        <!--
            COMMENT: This section should provide a map of the conference space that shows the following information:
            - the location of stairs, escalators, elevators, restrooms and wheelchair-accessible restrooms.
            - walking distance between sessions and need to use stairs.
            - places to sit and rest.
            - whether there will be a quiet place where hard of hearing people can talk.
            - whether there will be a private room where an attendee could rest or nurse a baby.
            - where a guide dog can be taken to relieve itself.

            COMMENT: For the benefit of those who cannot see the map, a textual description should also be included.
            Here’s an example of what this description might look like for a small event in a hotel:
        -->

        <p>For the overall layout of the venue, please refer to this <a href="https://www.thegalmont.com/en/meetings-floor-plans-capacities/">map of the conference
        space</a>.</p>

        <p>All conference events are on the ground floor of the hotel. The main conference will take place in the Inis Mor ballroom.  The Inis Mor ballroom comprises three sections:  Section 1 will be for posters, and Sections 2 and 3 will be combined to form the large room for the paper sessions.  Tea/coffee breaks will be in the coffee area just outside the ballroom, and lunches will be in the Marina's Grill restaurant.</p>

        <p>The closest accessible restrooms are located on this level, between the ballroom and the restaurant.  An alternative accessible restroom is located down one level, and can be accessed via the elevators in the main lobby.  These restrooms may not have sufficient space to accommodate larger wheelchairs, and attendees requiring more spacious restrooms will need to use the facilities of their guest room.  Attendees who are not staying at the hotel and who will require use of a guest room restroom are asked to let the Accessibility Chair know as soon as possible, and no later than one week before the start of the conference.</p>

        <p>There is a quiet, private room nearby for attendees to use.  Please contact us if you are planning to attend the conference and may need to use this space. The hotel lobby has additional seating but is not a quiet area.</p>

        <p>The registration desk will be at the cloakroom between the main lobby and the ballroom.</p>  
         
        <p>The distance from the ballroom to the hotel reception is approximately 40ft, from the ballroom to the nearest accessible toilet is approximately 20ft, and from the ballroom to the restaurant is approximately 60ft.</p>

        <!-- FOLLOWUP:

        <h2><a name="q8">Will the conference be accessible by wheelchair or power scooter?</a></h2>

        <!--
            COMMENT: This section should provide information for wheelchair and power scooter users, including:
            - wheelchair access routes into the conference venue.
            - wheelchair route from the entrance or lobby to the meeting rooms and/or guest accommodation.
            - if venue is a hotel - wheelchair route from the hotel rooms to the meeting space.
            - location of wheelchair-accessible restrooms.
            - warnings about any steps or stairs between conference locations.
            - where to get more detailed information about accessibility at the venue.
            - if there will be a raised stage, will there be a ramp onto it?
            - wheelchair access and transportation for any offsite events.
        -->

        <p>Yes, the conference will be accessible to wheelchair users. The hotel entrance has automatic doors and is level with the sidewalk, and there is a low 
        (approx 2-3cm) curb from the sidewalk to the main drive. If approaching the hotel from the city centre, it is advisable to cross over to the hotel side of the road at the junction with the main road, as there are no curb cuts further along.</p>

        <p>The reception desk has a lowered section for wheelchair users, and the route to the elevators is level. The elevators lead to the guest rooms. Ten wheelchair-accessible guest rooms are available, each with a roll-in shower and grab rails. Two of these rooms have twin beds and the rest have king-size 
        beds.</p> 

        <p>The meeting room will have wheelchair spaces by the aisles. Student volunteers will be available on request to help with the lunch buffet. The Marina's Grill restaurant has tables on different levels, and spaces for wheelchairs will be reserved at lunch tables on ground level.</p>

        <p>For more information about wheelchair accessibility at the Galmont Hotel & Spa, please contact Dave Connolly
        at <a href="tel:+353 91 538574">+353 91 538574</a> or

        <h2><a name="q9">What are the restroom facilities like?</a></h2>

        <p>The closest accessible restrooms to the conference area are approximately 20 feet from the ballroom.

These restrooms may not have sufficient space to accommodate larger wheelchairs, and attendees requiring more spacious restrooms will need to use the facilities of their guest room. Attendees who are not staying at the hotel and who will require use of a guest room restroom are asked to let the Accessibility Chair know as soon as possible, and no later than one week before the start of the conference.</p>

        <h2><a name="q16">What food service will be provided?</a></h2>

        <p>The conference will provide morning and afternoon tea/coffee breaks in the area outside the ballroom.

Student volunteers will be available on request to help with the buffets.</p> 

        <p>If you have special dietary needs, please indicate these clearly on your registration form and also feel free to contact the Accessibility Chairs.</p>

        <h2><a name="q17">Can the conference accommodate special dietary needs?</a></h2>

        indicate this on your registration form. For more detailed information please contact the Accessibility Chairs.</p>

        <h2><a name="q18">Will the conference be a smoke-free environment?</a></h2>

        </p>

        <h2><a name="q19">What if I have a medical emergency or health problem during the conference?</a></h2>

        <p>In case of emergency call <a href="tel:999">999</a> for an
        ambulance. The nearest hospital is 2 km away. If you require non-urgent medical care, please
        contact Kyle Montague and Raja Kushalnagar at <a href="mailto:access-assets18@acm.org">access-assets18@acm.org</a> or ask any student
        volunteer. They will be able to help with getting information about local doctors, specialists, chiropractors, etc. For
        non-resident attendees, buying travel insurance that covers medical expenses is strongly recommended as fees
        for emergency treatment can be very high.</p>

        <h2><a name="q20">What is the accessibility of the off-site venues?</a></h2>
        <p>
            The Tuesday evening reception will be at <a href="https://www.tribeton.ie">Tribeton</a>. Tribeton is approximately 700m (10 minutes walk) from the Galmont and the route is mostly flat. The entrance is level with the sidewalk. There is a lift to bring people to the restaurant and bar area on the upper floor. There is an accessible toilet on the upper floor.
