            ASSETS POLICY ON PROGRAM COMMITTEES
        </h1>

        <h2 tabindex="0">
            Program Committee Members
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            The Program Committee is responsible for objectively and thoroughly
            reviewing all submissions, and for submitting timely, informative
            reviews that provide authors with feedback about their submissions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Program Committee members should be recognized experts in the subject
            area of the event. As an objective criterion, all Program Committee members
            should possess a Ph.D. For recurring events, the committee should not have
            a fixed membership, but rather be constituted each year to fit the changing
            needs of the conference.
        </p>

        <h2 tabindex="0">
            Reviewing Submissions
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            Submissions should be reviewed by the Program Committee members themselves, 
            rather than by their chosen delegates. Program Committee members are encouraged 
            to seek advice from external reviewers if needed, but they are still responsible 
            for having reviewed the submission themselves. Each submission should be reviewed 
            by at least three Program Committee members.
        </p>
        
        <h2 tabindex="0">
            Submissions from Organizing Committee Members
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            Please consult the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/conflict-of-interest/">
            ACM SIGACCESS Conflict of Interest Policy</a> for how conflicts of interest
            will be managed across activities related to the SIG. For the
            ASSETS conference, the following protocol has been established
            to comply with this policy: If the General Chair or Program
            Chair wishes to submit a Technical Paper (as either a sole or
            co-author) to the conference, then a Deputy Program Chair must
            be appointed. The Deputy Chair’s role is to appoint a third
            party, whose identity is unknown to the submitting author, to
            oversee the review process for that submission. This anonymity
            will enable an independent decision to be made about the paper.    
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This anonymous third party will appoint reviewers for the
            submission and will determine an overall score or ranking for
            the submission. To preserve the anonymity of the third party
            and reviewers, the review process for such submissions will be
            conducted “offline” from the regular website if necessary.
            After the Program Chair has made initial accept/reject
            determinations for the other papers, if the Deputy Chair
            determines that the submitted paper from the General Chair or
            Program Chair is not a clear accept or reject, then the third
            party will also be responsible for the final accept/reject
            decision on this paper.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A similar process can be employed by the chair of other conference
            activities (such as Posters and Demonstrations), if they wish to 
            submit a paper to that activity. All other members of conference 
            committees may submit to all activities.  Care must be taken that 
            these submissions are reviewed at least as stringently as other 
            submissions, in keeping with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/conflict-of-interest/">
            ACM SIGACCESS Conflict of Interest Policy</a>.

            Conflicts of Interest and Confidentiality of Submissions
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            ASSETS requires members of the Program Committee to adhere to the 
            highest of ethical standards. These standards are outlined in the 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/conflict-of-interest/">
            ACM SIGACCESS Conflict of Interest Policy</a>. Program Committee chairs must 
            ensure that these standards are not only met to the letter of the 
            policy but also to the spirit of its intent. This means that even 
            the appearance of a conflict of interest or breach of confidentiality 
            in the selection process should be avoided.
        </p>

        <p>
            A Program Committee member (including the chair of the committee) is 
            considered to have a conflict of interest on a submission on which they 
            are an author or that has an author in any of the categories identified 
            by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/conflict-of-interest/">
            ACM SIGACCESS Conflict of Interest Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Committee members must declare their conflicts to the program chair 
            before any reviews of the submissions begin.
        </p>

        <p>
            Committee members in conflict with an author will not be allowed to 
            see the reviews of the submission, nor will the names of the reviewers 
            be divulged. During any and all discussions of the submission (written 
            or verbal), the member in conflict will be barred from participating in 
            any way either actively or passively (e.g., by absenting themselves from 
            the room in which the discussion is being held, not being a recipient 
            of email, etc.).
        </p>

        <p>
            In case the program chair is in conflict, the chair will assign an alternate 
            chair for any submissions for which they have a conflict. This alternate chair 
            should be a member of the Program Committee who does not have a conflict. For 
            those submissions, the alternate chair will select the reviewers and will 
            conduct the reviews and any discussion without revealing the identities of the 
            reviewers to the Program Committee Chair.
        </p>

        <p>
            Submissions themselves and discussions conducted by a Program Committee during 
            the selection process are considered to be confidential.
        </p>

        <p>
            This conflict of interest and confidentiality policy extends to any supplemental 
            reviewers outside of the immediate Program Committee, if such reviewers are permitted 
            by the procedures of the committee. The committee member seeking the supplemental 
            review is responsible for ensuring the enforcement of the policy.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Program Chair will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the manuscripts submitted 
            are made available to and reviewed only by the Program Committee and supplemental reviewers 
            acting on behalf of the Program Committee. Neither ASSETS nor ACM guarantee the 
            confidentiality of the submitted manuscripts, and accept no liability in the event that the 
            manuscripts are distributed beyond the reviewers.
        </p>


        <h2 tabindex="0">
            Awards and Special Issues of Journals
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            By default, the PC Chair is the selection committee chair for awards and special issues of 
            journals. The Chair, however, may transfer the job of selection committee chair over to 
            someone selected by the SIGACCESS EC if they so choose. Transferring the job of selection 
            chair should occur if the PC Chair is in conflict with papers under consideration. The 
            selection committee chairs may appoint additional committee members if they so choose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exclusions to avoid conflict of interest:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Papers co-authored by members of the selection committee are not eligible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Papers in conflict with the selection committee chair(s) are not eligible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Papers in which the PC Chair or General Chair are a co-author are not eligible.
                </li>
            </ul>    
        </p>

        <h2 tabindex="0">
            Calls for Submissions/Participation
        </h2>

        <p>
            Conferences should require full-length, original papers for review.
            The conference website for the Calls for papers should reference the
            ASSETS Program Committee Conflict of Interest Policy. It should also
            include explicit prohibitions against the submission of papers that
            have been previously published or are being submitted elsewhere.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            All Calls should make authors aware of the 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy">
            ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism</a>. Authors must be asked 
            to indicate their understanding and acceptance of the policy and 
            procedures at the time of submission. This can normally be done as 
            part of the electronic submission process, such as through a checkbox 
            that must be checked in order for the submission to be recorded.
        </p>
