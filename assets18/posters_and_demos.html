            The Poster and Demonstration Session is an opportunity for presenting late-breaking results, ongoing research projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. 
            This session is an ideal platform for researchers and practitioners to present their work, engage in discussion regarding their work and receive valuable feedback. 
            Participants are invited to submit high-quality posters and demonstrations presenting novel ideas, designs, techniques, systems, tools, evaluations, scientific 
            investigations, methodologies, social issues or policy issues relating to any topics that may be of interest to the accessibility community. A poster is a great way to 
            test new ideas, generate interest in a research area, or describe useful or interesting work that is not substantial enough for a full paper presentation or present 
            late-breaking result. A demonstration is a great way to communicate inventive accessible computing and IT technologies in action.

            The extended abstract must clearly demonstrate relevance to accessibility research. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to accessibility, originality, potential 
            significance, topicality and clarity. A detailed list of suggested topics can be found in the <a href="call_for_papers.html">Call for Papers</a>.
