                <p>
                    Brendan Gallagher is a chartered accountant who spent his entire career in management consulting at staff and partner level in a leading financial services firm in the UK, Ireland and Switzerland. He has had overall responsibility for the development of management consultancy in Ireland at a time when there was little indigenous activity. The introduction of sophisticated information technology was used as a market entry strategy in the Irish private and public sectors. Development of professional skills was undertaken with colleagues from throughout Europe in joint training programmes. The Irish provided leadership in financial modelling before this was generally available and contributed at third level and post graduate level to the development of professional standards for an ever increasingly complex field.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>

        <p>
            The user experience panel will comprise of end users of accessible technology who have also been involved in the design and evaluation of digital innovations. During the session we will explore examples of how technology can enhance or hinder access to work, health and education. We will also consider how other contexts such as entertainment, fashion, cooking, music, travel and sport are affected by the availability of accessible solutions. We will explore the role of end users in the design of technology to support and promote accessibility. Panel members will share their perceptions and experiences of leading and/or participating in the design and evaluation of technologies and the delicate balance between engaging users without burdening them. We will also involve contributions from attendees of the ASSETS conference, and hope to include contributions from twitter.
