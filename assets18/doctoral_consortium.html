            DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM
        </h1>

        <p>
            The ASSETS 2018 Doctoral Consortium will be held on <b>Sunday, October 21, 2018</b>, in Galway, Ireland. During the Consortium, each student will make a formal presentation about his or her doctoral research. Feedback will be given by each member of the faculty panel, as well as by the other student participants. Discussion will be encouraged.
        </p>

        <p>
            The feedback will be geared toward helping student participants understand 
            and articulate how their work is positioned, relative to other research on 
            Assistive Technologies, Universal Accessibility, and Universal Usability. 
            Feedback will also address whether their topics are adequately focused for 
            thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and 
            applied, and whether their results are being appropriately analyzed and 
            presented.
        </p>

        <p>
            Student participants will also present their research in the main conference 
            during a poster session that is dedicated specifically to the work of the 
            Doctoral Consortium participants. This will allow conference attendees to 
            interact with, and ask questions of, the Doctoral Consortium participants, 
            and will allow the participants the opportunity to get feedback from a larger 
            audience.
        </p>

        <p>
            The abstract must clearly demonstrate relevance to accessibility research. 
            Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to accessibility, 
            originality, potential significance, topicality and clarity. A detailed list 
            of suggested topics can be found in the <a href="call_for_papers.html">Call for Papers</a>.

            Goals of the Consortium
        </h2>
        <p>
            The overall goals of the Consortium are to:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Provide a supportive setting for promising young researchers 
                    to give a short, critiqued research presentation, and then 
                    receive feedback from other student participants, and from 
                    established researchers in the field of Assistive Technologies, 
                    Universal Accessibility, and Universal Usability about their 
                    current research, as well as guidance on future research directions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide opportunities for the student participants to make contact 
                    with experts in the field, and to receive fresh perspectives and 
                    comments on their work from researchers outside their own 
                    institution - including both faculty and students.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enable the student participants to attend the ASSETS 2018 conference, 
                    to contribute to the conference goals through interaction with other 
                    researchers and conference events, to learn of potential career paths 
                    within academia and industry, and to gain access to an international 
                    network of researchers who can support their professional development.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The overall purpose of the Consortium is to encourage and prepare a group of
            promising young researchers dedicated to Assistive Technologies, Universal
            Accessibility, and Universal Usability.

            Who Should Apply
        </h2>
       
        <p>
            The purpose of the Doctoral Consortium is to provide feedback to Doctoral
            candidates at an early stage of their research, in order to help guide and
            shape their research program. Students submitting proposals to the Doctoral
            Consortium may also submit a different piece of work to the Student Research
            Competition, but may not submit the same work to both the Doctoral Consortium
            and the Student Research Competition.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Student work that is complete, or near to completion, should be 
            submitted as either a technical paper or a poster.
        </p>
