            CALL FOR PAPERS
        </h1>
        
        <p>
            The ASSETS conference is the premier forum for presenting research on the design, evaluation, and use of computing and information technologies to benefit people with disabilities and older adults.
        </p>

        <p>
            We invite high-quality, original submissions on topics relevant to computers and accessibility. This includes the use of technology by and in support of:
            <ul>
                <li>Individuals who are Deaf/deaf or hard-of-hearing</li>
                <li>Individuals who are blind or visually impaired</li>
                <li>Individuals with other sensory impairments</li>
                <li>Individuals with motor impairments</li>
                <li>Individuals with memory, learning, and cognitive impairments</li>
                <li>Individuals with developmental disabilities</li>
                <li>Individuals with multiple impairments</li>
                <li>Older adults and others with diverse or changing capabilities</li>
                <li>Professionals who work with or in support of these populations</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Submissions should present significant and innovative contributions to design, systems, tools, scientific understanding, methodology, social issues or policy related to:
            <ul>
                <li>Technology that improves the accessibility of everyday life</li>
                <li>Technology that improves access to computer and information technologies</li>
                <li>Accessibility and usability of mainstream technologies</li>
                <li>Exploration of barriers to technology access</li>
                <li>Using mainstream technologies to improve accessibility</li>
                <li>Technological innovations that could be used to improve access</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Where relevant, work that includes empirical data from the target user group is strongly preferred. ASSETS strives to publish research that carefully addresses the issues involved when individuals with disabilities interact with information technologies. In general, this means that empirical studies should include participants that are representative of the intended users of the system being studied. This does not mean that all participants must be representative of the intended users, but it does mean that some individuals fitting this description should be included in an appropriate way in the data collection process. In some cases, articles may be accepted for publication if representative users are not included in studies, but only if a sufficiently compelling argument is presented as to why it is appropriate or necessary to use non-representative users and any implications of this decision are adequately addressed. Authors should refer to the <a href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-writing-guide/" target="_blank">General Writing Guidelines for Technology and People with Disabilities</a> when preparing submissions.
