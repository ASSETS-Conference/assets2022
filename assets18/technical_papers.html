        <p>
            The ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility (ASSETS) is the premier forum for presenting research on the design, 
            evaluation, and use of computing and information technologies to benefit people with disabilities and older adults. We invite high-quality, 
            original submissions on topics relevant to computers and accessibility. This includes the use of technology by and in support of:

        <p>
            Where relevant, work that includes empirical data from the target user group is strongly preferred. 
            ASSETS strives to publish research that carefully addresses the issues involved when individuals with 
            disabilities interact with information technologies. In general, this means that empirical studies 
            should include participants that are representative of the intended users of the system being studied. 
            This does not mean that all participants must be representative of the intended users, but it does mean 
            that some individuals fitting this description should be included in an appropriate way in the data 
            collection process. In some cases, articles may be accepted for publication if representative users 
            are not included in studies, but only if a sufficiently compelling argument is presented as to why it 
            is appropriate or necessary to use non-representative users and any implications of this decision are 
            adequately addressed. Authors should refer to the 
            <a href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-writing-guide/" target="_blank">
            General Writing Guidelines for Technology and People with Disabilities
            </a> when preparing submissions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Accepted technical papers will be presented at the conference and will appear in the conference proceedings. 
            For the accepted papers, at least one author must register as the presenter by the early registration deadline 
            to be included in the proceedings. All authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit extended versions of 
            their papers to a special issue of the <a href="http://www.rit.edu/gccis/taccess/index.html" target="_blank">
            ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS)</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Authors who have never published at ASSETS can request a mentor. Mentors will be experienced ASSETS contributors, 
            who can help authors to improve their submissions. See the <a href="call_for_mentors.html">Call for Mentors page</a> 
            for more information.

            Submission Guidelines
        </h2>

        <h3 tabindex="0">
            Format and Length
        </h3>

        <p>
            In 2018, the length of Technical Papers for the ASSETS conference is limited to <b>10 pages</b>. 
            Additionally, as was introduced at ASSETS 2017, we will have a Short Technical Paper category, limited to <b>5 pages</b>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            New for 2018, references <u>do not</u> count toward page limits.
        </p>

        <p>
            Submissions should use templates that can be found in the <a href="submission_templates.html">Submission Templates page</a>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Video figures up to five minutes long may be optionally submitted as supplementary material. Video figures are strongly encouraged for papers 
            that introduce a novel system or interaction technique. Video figures should be in .mp4 format and should be less than 50 MB.
        </p>

         <h3 tabindex="0" id="Accessible_Submissions">
            Accessible Submissions
        </h3>

        <h4>Accessible PDFs</h4>

        <p>
            Your PDF file must be accessible. PDFs created with LaTex are very difficult to make accessible, unless you edit the output directly in Acrobat; 
            we strongly suggest using Microsoft Word due to the easier accessibility workflow. It may take you about an hour to  make your file accessible 
            (adding alt tags, etc.), so be sure to leave time before the submission deadline to do so. Please refer to the instructions on 
            <a href="creating_accessible_pdfs.html">Creating an Accessible ACM Conference Paper</a> for information on how to accomplish this. If you cannot create an accessible PDF at submission time then you will be given the option to upload either an accessible HTML or Microsoft Word version of your paper in addition to your PDF to facilitate review. If your paper is accepted, the final version will need to be transformed into an accessible PDF document.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that making an accessible PDF is not well-supported by any standard LaTex editors that we are aware of. If you use LaTex you will need to manually edit your PDF using Adobe Acrobat in order to make it accessible.
        </p>

        <!-- This year, we are conducting a small test of producing HTML papers via a new tool pipeline that involves a simple, 
            shared HTML editor combined with a special .css file and PDF conversion tool to produce an accessible HTML document in addition to an ACM-formatted PDF; if you are a 
            current LaTex user who would like to instead try our new HTML ecosystem in order to produce more accessible output and provide us with feedback on how to improve this 
            system for future ASSETS conferences, then please send email to us at <a href="mailto:pc-assets17@acm.org">pc-assets17@acm.org</a>. -->

        <h4>Accessible Video Figures</h4>

        <p>
            Video figures, like papers, must be accessible. For videos to be accessible, include both audio narration (so that the contents of the video can be understood by someone 
            with a visual impairment) as well as text captions (so that the video can be understood by someone who is deaf or hard of hearing). Text captions can be burned directly 
            into the video as subtitles (preferred), or else closed-captioning metadata files (*.srt, *.ttml, *.vtt) can be uploaded as additional supplementary material.
        </p>

        <h3 tabindex="0">
            Anonymous Submissions
        </h3>

        <p>
            ASSETS will utilize a double-blind review process for Technical Papers, in which the <b>authors must anonymize their paper submissions</b>. We will follow the standard of SIGCHI in which all author names, affiliations, and contact information is to be removed. You should not anonymize references to your prior work (these are needed as part of the review process). Rather, you should refer to all prior work in the third person. While it may not be possible to remove all clues to who the authors are, we expect authors to do their best.
        </p>

        <p>
           Videos should be anonymized for blind review (i.e., do not include author or institution names in videos).
        </p>

        <h3 tabindex="0">
            Review Process
        </h3>

        <p>
            Submissions that do not meet formatting or accessibility guidelines, are not properly anonymized, are out of the topical scope of the conference, or are otherwise deemed non-competitive by the program chairs may be rejected without review. Otherwise, submissions will be peer-reviewed by 
            <a href="program_committee.html">an international panel</a>, per the <a href="policy_program_committees.html">ASSETS policy on Program Committees</a>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            For ASSETS 2018, authors with sufficiently high review scores will have an opportunity to submit a “Rebuttal” after viewing the reviews, prior to the final acceptance decisions. The window of time for this rebuttal period is only a few days, so authors should plan to make time for this. 
            See <a href="#imp_dates">Important Dates</a>, above.
        </p>

        <p>
            Submissions MUST contain substantial original, unpublished material. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism" target="_blank">ACM policy on plagiarism</a> for guidance. <a href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-writing-guide/" target="_blank">Writing Guidelines</a> are available to help authors choose appropriate language for writing about technology and people with 
            disabilities. Authors of accepted papers should note that papers may be made publically available in the ACM Digital Library as far as two weeks in advance of the conference date.
        </p>

        <h3>Short vs. Long Papers</h3>

        <p>
            Last year ASSETS introduced a “Short Technical Papers” category. Short papers are meant to capture more focused, concise research contributions than full papers. Short papers, like full papers, are rigorously peer-reviewed, archival publications. Short papers are not for works-in-progress, incomplete work, etc. (Works-in-progress should be submitted to the <a href="posters_and_demos.html">Posters and Demos</a> track). Short paper submissions should 
            use the same template as full-length technical papers, but are limited to five pages. Accepted short papers will appear in the main conference proceedings, and will be orally presented at the conference (in a half-length presentation slot). Short papers should adhere to the same anonymity and accessibility standards as full papers, and are also welcome to submit accompanying video figures, particularly if they introduce a novel system or interaction technique. For either short or long papers, you are not obligated to fill the entire page quota; a good rule of thumb is that the length of your paper should be proportional to the contribution size.
        </p>
