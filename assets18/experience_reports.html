            EXPERIENCE REPORTS
        </h1>

        <p>
            The value of accessible and assistive technology is measured ultimately by the experience of people who use it. ASSETS 2018 invites papers that reflect these experiences first-hand. These papers will be reflective in nature and give authors an opportunity to consider how their experiences of using technology can inform both practice and research. Experience reports must be authored or co-authored by one or more persons who use the technology. Authors may be from the user population discussed in the report or they may be a rehabilitation professional (not involved in the design and development of technology) who is involved in identifying, training and providing ongoing support of technology with clients in the target user population. This latter type of author is meant to provide the opportunity to represent multiple users who themselves may not want to write an experience report.
        </p>

        <p>
            The technology and the focus of the report should be described citing appropriate references. The report should describe the authors’ or clients’ experience with the technology, positive or negative (and may describe the experience of other users, as well). There should be a critical reflection in which aspects of the experience are discussed in relation to relevant literature and practice. Due to the practical nature of the reports, authors are encouraged to reflect on how their experience can inform future research (e.g. identifying a research challenge) or practice (e.g. demonstrating changes in policy). The technology involved may be in any state of completion that allows meaningful use, from a research prototype to a commercial product.
