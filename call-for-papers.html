                        The ASSETS conference is the premier forum for presenting research on the design, evaluation, use, and education related
                        to computing for people with disabilities and older adults. We invite high-quality original submissions on topics
                        relevant to computing and accessibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Submissions should present significant contributions to design, systems, tools, scientific understanding, methodology,
                        or social issues. Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) new enabling technologies, studies of how
                        technologies are used by people with disabilities, explorations of barriers to access, and evaluations of accessibility
                        education methods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is expected that, in most cases, a paper’s research contributions will be validated through research activities
                        conducted within the target user groups. We will prioritize papers that report work involving people who have
                        accessibility needs. For papers that focus on older users, we will prioritize papers that focus on specific
                        accessibility concerns of older users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We recommend that papers with a technical contribution be validated through research activities with representative
                        users when possible. However, we acknowledge that many accessibility-focused projects may begin with deep formative work
                        with representative users, or may be based on prior research with representative users, and as such key contributions of
                        a single paper may be primarily technical. For papers that focus on a technical contribution, we expect that this
                        contribution has been validated in formative work with representative users, or at least is solidly anchored in prior
                        research with representative users. Authors of papers with a primarily technical contribution should make it clear in
                        their background section how the technical design is motivated by representative users’ documented needs and concerns,
                        while following the anonymity requirements for submissions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please be sure that your use of language regarding older adults and people with disabilities follows up-to-date
                        community guidance. Specifically, avoid terms such as "vulnerable," "special needs," "suffering from," "normal," or "X
                        challenged," etc., and focus language to be inclusive. Authors should refer to the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/2828432" target="_blank">General Writing Guidelines for
                        Technology and People with Disabilities</a> or the <a href="https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-writing-guide/"> SIGACCESS Accessible Writing Guide when preparing submissions.</a>

                    <p>
                        It is important that the submissions themselves are already accessible so that everyone who needs to check and comment
                        on your manuscript during the review process can do so. If you are new to this process, refer to the guide on creating
                        accessible submissions, please refer to the <a href="guidelines-policies.html"> Guidelines & Policies</a> on this website.

                        <p>
                            ASSETS accepts submissions in the following categories:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Technical Papers</li>
                            <li>Posters and Demonstrations (call to come)</li>
                            <li>Experience Reports (call to come)</li>
                            <li>Doctoral Consortium (call to come)</li>
                            <li>Student Research Competition (call to come)</li>
                            <li>Workshops (call to come)</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Technical papers are expected to present significant and original contributions. For early work and work-in-progress,
                            authors may consider submitting a poster or demo. Papers may expand upon previously published posters or demos, but must
                            present novel and significantly extended content, and should cite any previous abstracts for posters or demos. Please
                            refer to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview" target="_blank"> ACM policy on plagiarism for guidance. </a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All Technical Papers and Posters and Demonstrations submissions are peer-reviewed by an international Program Committee.
                            Accepted papers and the abstracts for posters and demonstrations, experience reports, and the student research
                            competition will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of accepted submissions must register as
                            the presenter by the early registration deadline. The ASSETS 2023 conference is planned as primarily an in-person event
                            in the New York, NY, area. While the conference organizers are planning for a digital-participation option for
                            attendees, details are still being finalized. For technical papers, the expectation is that at least one author will
                            attend the conference in person to present. If no authors of a submission will be able to travel due to accessibility or
                            health concerns, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the Technical Programme Chairs, Erin Brady and Maria
                            Wolters, at <a href="mailto:tpc-assets23@acm.org"> tpc-assets23@acm.org </a> to discuss potential alternatives for presentation of the work.

                    <p>As in previous years, ASSETS will present a Best Paper Award, for the best overall paper submitted to the conference, as well as a Best Student Paper Award, for a paper primarily authored by a student.</p>
                    <p>ASSETS will also present a Best Artifact Award, for a paper, poster, or demo that relates to the best publicly released artifact, such as an application or commercial product. This award will go to work that has the greatest potential for impact in the real world for end users, developers, or researchers. This award will be attached to existing submission types; during submission of a paper, poster, or demo, you will be given the opportunity to include a link to a publicly available artifact that relates to that work.</p>
