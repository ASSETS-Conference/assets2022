                    <p>The ASSETS conference is the premier forum for presenting research on the design, evaluation, use, and education related to computing for people with disabilities and older adults. We invite high-quality original submissions on topics relevant to computing and accessibility.</p>
                    <p>Submissions should present significant contributions to design, systems, tools, scientific understanding, methodology, or social issues. Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) new enabling technologies, studies of how technologies are used by people with disabilities, explorations of barriers to access, and evaluations of accessibility education methods. It is expected that, in most cases, a paper’s research contributions will be validated through research activities conducted within the target user groups. Papers that include a technical contribution without being validated through research activities with representative users are unlikely to be accepted.</p>
                    <p>Authors should refer to the <a href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-writing-guide/">General Writing Guidelines for Technology and People with Disabilities</a> when preparing submissions.</p>
                    <p>Accepted technical papers will be presented at the conference and will appear in the conference proceedings. For the accepted papers, at least one author must register as the presenter by the early registration deadline to be included in the proceedings. All authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to a special issue of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/taccess">ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS)</a>.</p>
                    <p>Authors who have never published at ASSETS can request a mentor. Mentors will be experienced ASSETS contributors, who can help authors to improve their submissions. See the <a href="call-for-mentoring-request.html">Call for Mentors page</a> for more information.</p>

                    <h4>Paper Format and Length</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We will be using The ACM Publication System (TAPS) process to generate final multi-format representations of accepted papers.</li>
                        <li>The correct template for submission is: single column Word Submission Template and single column LaTeX (using “manuscript” style available in the template).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The length of most accepted technical papers will be in the range of 7,500 to 10,000 words (4,000 to 5,000 for short technical papers); note that references do not count towards these word counts. Papers with many figures and tables should err on the shorter side of the word count range. For either short or long papers, you are not obligated to fill the entire page quota; a good rule of thumb is that the length of your paper should be commensurate with its contribution.</p>

                    <p>Submissions should use templates that can be found in the <a href="submission-templates.html">Submission Templates page</a>.</p>

                    <h4>Accessible Submissions</h4>
                    <p>Your PDF file must be accessible. It may take several hours to make your PDF file accessible (adding alt tags, <i>etc.</i>), so be sure to leave time before the submission deadline to do so. Please refer to the instructions on <a href="guidelines-policies.html#a11y-pdfs">Creating an Accessible ACM Conference Paper</a> for information on how to accomplish this.</p>

                    <p>It is expected that papers will be made accessible both at the time of review and for the final submission. Paper submissions that are not accessible may be desk rejected. If you have questions regarding how to make your paper accessible, please contact <a href="mailto:proceedings-assets22@acm.org">proceedings-assets22@acm.org</a>. If you think you could benefit from a <a href="mentoring.html">mentor</a> to help you with this process, please contact <a href="mailto:mentoring-assets22@acm.org">mentoring-assets22@acm.org</a>.</p>

                    <h5>Optional Accessible Video Figures as Supplementary Material</h5>
                    <p>You may include optional video figures to accompany your paper submissions as supplementary material, which may be up to <b>five minutes</b> long. There is a separate upload field in the PrecisionConference website. Video figures are strongly encouraged for papers that introduce a novel system or interaction technique. Video figures are not the same as video presentations of accepted papers that are shown during the conference. </p>

                    <p>Video figures should be in .mp4 format and should be less than 50 MB. Like papers, video figures must be accessible. For videos to be accessible, include both audio narration (so that the contents of the video can be understood by someone with a visual impairment) as well as text captions (so that the video can be understood by someone who is deaf or hard of hearing). Text captions can be burned directly into the video as subtitles (preferred), or else closed-captioning metadata files (*.srt, *.ttml, *.vtt) can be uploaded as additional supplementary material. Please also refer to the guidance on <a href="guidelines-policies.html#a11y-videos">Accessible Video Figures</a>.</p>

                    <h4>Anonymous Submissions</h4>
                    <p>ASSETS will utilize a fully-anonymous review process for Technical Papers, in which the <b>authors must anonymize their paper submissions, all supplemental materials, and video figures</b>. We will follow the standard of SIGCHI in which all author names, affiliations, and contact information must be removed. You should not anonymize references to your prior work (these are needed as part of the review process). Rather, you should refer to all prior work in the third person. While it may not be possible to remove all clues to who the authors are, we expect authors to do their best. Authors who encounter difficulty applying this anonymization policy to their research are encouraged to contact the program chairs for additional guidance.</p>

                    <p>Supplemental video figures should be anonymized for review (<i>i.e.,</i> do not include author or institution names in videos).</p>

                    <h4>Review Process</h4>
                    <p>Submissions that do not meet formatting or accessibility guidelines, are not properly anonymized, are out of the topical scope of the conference, or are otherwise deemed non-competitive by the program chairs may be rejected without review. Otherwise, submissions will be peer-reviewed by an <a href="program-committee.html">international panel</a>, per the <a href="policy-on-committees.html">ASSETS policy on Program Committees</a>.</p>
                    <p>Authors with sufficiently high review scores will have an opportunity to submit a “Rebuttal” after viewing the reviews, prior to the final acceptance decisions. The window of time for this rebuttal period is about a week, so authors should plan to make time for this. See <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a>, above.</p>

                    <p>Submissions MUST contain substantial original, unpublished material. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview" target="_blank">ACM policy on plagiarism</a>. <a href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-writing-guide/" target="_blank">Writing Guidelines</a> are available to help authors choose appropriate language for writing about technology and people with disabilities. Authors of accepted papers should note that papers may be made publically available in the ACM Digital Library as far as two weeks in advance of the conference date.</p>

                    <h4>Short <i>vs.</i> Long Papers</h4>
                    <p>Short papers are meant to capture more focused, concise research contributions than full papers. Short papers, like full papers, are rigorously peer-reviewed, archival publications. Short papers are not for works-in-progress, incomplete work, <i>etc.</i> (Works-in-progress should be submitted to the <a href="posters-and-demos.html" target="_blank">Posters and Demos category</a>).</p>

                    <p>Short paper submissions should use the same template as full-length technical papers, but should be limited to 4,000 to 5,000 words, not including references. Accepted short papers will appear in the main conference proceedings, and will be orally presented at the conference (in a half-length presentation slot). Short papers should adhere to the same anonymity and accessibility standards as full papers, and may also include accompanying video figures (see previous section on <i>Optional Accessible Video Figures as Supplementary Material</i>), particularly if they introduce a novel system or interaction technique.</p>

                    <h4>Mentorship Available </h4>
                    <p>Mentoring is an important process that helps bring new researchers into the ASSETS community and to ensure that papers are accessible to everyone. We have two types of mentorship available: Paper Writing Mentorship and Accessible Submission Mentorship.</p>

                    <p><b>Paper Writing Mentorship:</b> Help from seasoned researchers is available through the ASSETS Mentoring Program. You may receive advice on a submission in any of the submission categories provided by ASSETS. If you think you would benefit from mentoring because you are new to presenting your research, new to the type of category you would like to submit to, or seek assistance in preparing an English-language paper, please consider applying for mentoring help. The deadline to request a Paper Writing Mentor is Tuesday, February 15, 2022. </p>

                    <p><b>Accessible Submissions Mentorship:</b> It is expected that papers will be made accessible both at the time of review and for the final submission. Paper submissions that are not accessible may be desk rejected. If you think you could benefit from a mentor to help you with this writing informative alt tags and making the paper accessible, please consider applying for mentoring help. The deadline to request an Accessible Submission Mentor is Tuesday, March 15, 2022.</p>

                    <p>Please refer to <a href="mentoring.html">Mentoring</a> for more information.</p>

                    <h4>IMPORTANT - Author PCS Account Details</h4>
                    <p>ACM continues to update the publication process and now paper metadata will be pulled directly from your personal PCS account. This means that it is crucial for you and all of your co-authors to update the contact information so that names, affiliations, AND primary email addresses are stylized exactly in the way that you all would want to see them in the ACM digital library and on your paper. For example, if you use a personal email address (<i>xyz123@hotmail.com</i>) as your primary contact email in PCS then this email will appear on your paper. Please <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?next=https%3A//new.precisionconference.com/contact_info" target="_blank">check your author information and make necessary changes</a>.</p>
